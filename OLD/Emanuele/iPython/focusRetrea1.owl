        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">No.nSP2	But I think overall there is definitely a positive feedback, you know the projects of the students, what they have done.  You know also where difficulties were encountered in terms of feasibility of projects, I think you also get a good sense of judging what kind of project is possible in a given timeframe.  That is I think that can be translated to same as the projects or master projects that you can define a project for a student that is challenging but still feasible.  And not after three months you realise oh, this was only the introduction and there is no time to do the core of the work.nSP1	Okay.nSP2	So I think that is nice and then it also opens a bit perspectives for your own research that you know also other colleagues, you know their work and I think if need be you could integrate elements from this experience.  And use the network of the Semaine ENAC to incorporate or to link your work or elements of their work with what you are doing.nSP1	So for your own interdisciplinary work if you like.nSP2	And finally it also helps for teaching other classes I think you can always make reference to a...

Because they did not even know the names of basic tools, so I think from this point they learnt a lot.  n	And then the second thing was to have to work together, and they learnt how the architects worked, how civil engineering are thinking and working and some of the other side they had to help them, because architects they can, they do drawings so they draw for civil engineers, and civil engineers help architects to design structures.

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en"> And what do you think about the competences in this and ENAC, which are the key competences, your top?nSP2	So think we have this true interdisciplinary ream where we have, first of all, you know, we are from the environmental sciences service, strong background in energy and mass transport questions, energy balance, everything that has to do with the physics of the earth surface.  That�s the key competence on the environmental sciences question, so we can measure heat fluxes with them, we can measure radiation transfer and explain them how diffuse or and direct radiation works and how that is reflected by the snow surface.  n	Things like that are key competences and then we combine that with the competence on how to actually construct and design buildings, also from an energy point of view.  And that is more the architectural side of competence that we bring in there.  Where we have a focus however again on the energy physics so we�re doing a lot of... The students choose to do something with renewable energy, say solar or wind in the mountain environment, a little bit of hydro power.

And being able to concentrate the energy and join forces to achieve a good quality project. And again I think, think out of the box. And learning to work in a broad perspective of sustainability, and getting familiar with new themes like energy; energy deficiency or economic feasibility.nSP1	Yes, so yes. On more concerning the social aspects, what do you think about the social competencies?nSP2	I think this is a bit lacking. I think it�s probably still a bit lacking in academia when talking about environmental design, unfortunately. Although we� There is potential inside [inaudible], I think, to get more collaboration with people who work in this direction, and I would be very interested in working, for example, on some interdisciplinary projects who also take into account social aspects.

If they want to measure something then we have to show them how to set up the instruments, how to read out the data on the logger, how to... n	We give them also preconfigured Excel sheets because otherwise in a week it will be difficult for them to programme enough to get stuff out.  So they get first solid hands-on experience by supervised work that they do themselves, I mean we really focus on that they should do the work themselves.  And also do some background search on the internet, see what data they find and if we have the impression that they didn�t find the right data then we point them to the right sources or even give them the data like on energy production and things.</Focus:content>

And then in terms of teaching we are a big team I think, like this year we were six, seven for 25 students that�s quite an impressive ratio.  And we accompany them in their process of doing a project and we interact a lot with them in group discussions like all the experts from the teaching side talking to the individual groups.  We have usually groups of five students and so after the lectures it becomes really, really interactive and another I think interesting tool that we are using is what we call the desk critique.  That all teachers come typically twice during the week and visit the small groups and we discuss with them their project, this is like a collective, interactive discussion.</Focus:content>

So from this point of view it was really an exchange.  That�s what I think one of the main goals [?] in the ENAC Week.</Focus:content>

And how does that context and they apply for F&amp;S grant, they didn�t have it.  It was a [inaudible] research and one of the main critic had in the expertise was the luck of social dimension, a cultural dimension of the project.nSP1	Okay.nSP2	So that was the very base of the project where Alan proposed to Eva [inaudible] as a people representing a different lab or institute to try to collaborate together and to launch a new project.  Which includes really our EIJS our competencies about cultural and social dimension.  And so we launch this project we won one of the seed money amongst others and on the same line Alan decided to launch also the ENAC week with a high potential because it includes multidisciplinary project. nSP1	Yes.nSP2	And so this... All this project plus since 2014 we had some semester project also based globally on the use of containers in different situation and all these different activities actually form actually the core... Basic core of this ENAC.

Because other countries will be more impacted than Switzerland, so the demand will go to Switzerland and the price will increase and the value added will increase.

Well all cases are particular I assume.  I got involved when shortly after Mihi [?] arrived here as a prof and he was kind of building up his teaching activities.  And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from...

So we can also, we have a little tradition already so that we can definitely talk about an evolution.  The evolution was linked a little bit to the teaching staff where we had over the years a bit of fluctuation.  Some people joining, some people leaving and of course this always brings a little bit different... New elements in a way but we did not change the overall topic that remained.  But I think from year to year we got a bit more professional and more experience.  The topics remained, we also saw after the first one or two editions what was feasible, what we can ask for, what they can do in a week.  And I think at the end as I said we... The topic did not change so much, that means we did in my opinion a pretty good choice at the beginning.  Which was fairly well thought because the very first year we really spent a lot of times, we had long documents and we were circulating these documents between teaching staff part of... Or teachers of this particular Semaine ENAC.  And tailored it such that we really integrated elements from all three sections.

And then, you know, it was just I think brainstorming about how that could be put into place.  nAnd I think the idea of kind of making seemed a natural way to work.  And then, you know, the question of kind of what they make, what they could build became an important one, or an interesting one.  And I had seen that there was a competition that I think ENAC sponsored to build a bridge out of toothpicks.  nOr something like this that they do every year, where architects and sometimes engineers end up doing some proposed, you know, a model that they then have to use to carry a certain weight.  So that made me think something in that context.  nBut I wanted it to be at a larger scale.  And I wanted it to be at the scale of an actual object that would have an actual function, also.  And then, the idea of the cantilever was just something that I had been thinking about.  Obviously, just as an interesting kind of structural idea, which has also certain kinds of implications, in terms of kind of its representational or representative qualities.  nSo it brought together kind of structural ideas with architectural ideas with also, in terms of building that out of wood.  I think, you know, this idea of kind of resources or materials, and what that would mean to work with that.</Focus:content>

And that�s also what we realised, so when we had, as I said, this Wim van der Hoede [?] who was quite essential in the initial setup of the project, he brought in more architectural aspects for very small models, so it was important for him to look at the structural properties of these models.  n	And so you have to, I think the recipe for success is get a good, it�s like always, get a good team and then, you know, and then see where is the compromise between the team and the original idea.  And then let the thing evolve.</Focus:content>

To capitalise from the fact that I was working on walking and that Emmanuel also has an interest in walking � Emmanuel Ravalet.  So, I think she saw the opportunity to put our strengths, and perhaps weaknesses, together, to create something new.  </Focus:content>

Sometimes for the economics there is some resistance, the students, they don�t like the capitalist guy.

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">And well so last question for this part which are the key or is the key interdisciplinary aspect of your week?  How would you describe it?nSP2	We tried to put as much of these aspects in the title of the Semaine ENAC, the title was a little longer, I think a few years ago and then the academic service said you have 140 characters or whatever and we had to reduce.  So I think our original idea was to group the interdisciplinary aspect around two key words.  One is renewable energy and this is really applied to different scales, like from the smallest scale of having a small standalone unit to large scale energy production.  Or energy storage in the landscape.  And the second element is I would say sustainability, again, in a very large sense sustainability with respect to or applied to landscape and a natural environment and to build infrastructure.  And bringing all these together I think we have two elements that give a wealth of questions, interesting and relevant to the students of the three sections.  Because all of them are concerned with energy question, the architects when designing buildings, the civil engineers anyway for maybe power production.  The environmental engineering... Engineers as well for also handling energy, transmission.  nBut then also citing of infrastructures work and they put these things where we have natural risks and hazards, how does it integrate in the landscape, how does it integrate with valid regulations and law and so on?  And in this context I should also mention that... And that�s maybe a bit particular of our Semaine ENAC that we are also covering economic aspects which I think is nice and it�s probably for most of them a new element.  They don�t have this in class or anything, we have a dedicated specialist or expert for that and I think it�s a nice component to bring... To develop a project where you also do at least a basic calculation to see that it�s something realistic and maybe viable.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">What�s your main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?nSP2	So, there are a few reasons why I choose to be involved in this Semaine ENAC. First of all because I was interested in improving my teaching skills so it was for really personal interest. And I was really excited to work in an interdisciplinary environment because throughout my education� So both my master�s degree in architectural engineering which is already kind of hybrid and interdisciplinary by definition, and then a PhD as an engineer, got in the Department of Architecture, carrying out a thesis which focused on environmental design, was already sort of in keeping on working on interdisciplinarity in my studies. nAnd so I became more and more aware of the importance of interdisciplinarity today, which in the field of construction and building environment in general is definitely essential. So both at the research and professional level, and started to be considered also as an essential framework for the teaching practice.nAlso I wanted to give myself this challenge, I found it very interesting, and I also liked a lot the fact of coupling theory and practice, that I thought was very interesting as well. nAnd also having some fun, so having some regenerative time with the students in a different environment and out of the usual and daily routine standards of academic, yes, routine.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">What was your motivation to engage in the ENAC week?nSP2	 So, honestly, I was a master student here in this group, in LIPID, and I was followed by Parag who was involved in the course before me. So he was going to finish and he was saying, I would like you to follow my path so why don�t you start to do that. nBut actually I wasn�t a PhD yet, so I started even before being a PhD, and then when I became a PhD I just continued to do the Semaine ENAC. Even if it�s completely different from what I�m doing, but I� Because I want to be broad in my studies so I feel like it�s a great opportunity for me to exploit the different areas of, yes, building physics still, but different.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">So, again as I told you before, it is something not related to my topic, but to me it�s enriching because every time also working with students, I�m learning stuff. And each project is unique so it helping me also for the future to maybe understand different problems. For me it�s like I was doing all the projects, so it was nice. Of course I was not solving their problems, but at the end I was kind of involved. So to me it was� It�s enriching also for me, of course.nSP1	That�s great.nSP2	Yes, in a really different topic so not related to my PhD but in general I think at the end of my PhD I just don�t want to be an expert in a really tiny part of building physics, so I would like to have a broader knowledge.

The approach was about snow and it turned out to be, like, an initiation into economics to finance for engineers.  And it�s very nice that this, the few first years I learned a lot about how did the engineers see the things and stuff, and what I can bring them.  So that�s why I�m still involved, and there are a few research projects that we are still talking about that may come out of the Semaine ENAC. </Focus:content>

And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from... More the lead on Mihi to get involved in something.

And we had, for the first, as one Week is very short, so we had the Week before and Monday, Tuesday, we used these to get together with all of the fixed groups and to start working before the Week and with the know-how already of what they had to do and so they can get some information from the internet and some other places.  So we were really, how can I say this, we were running already, otherwise it takes one or two days to be efficient.  The first day was kind of the special, making specialists or project specialists and the second day was about making the project, being in the classroom, and the third day this was working on the site.  But then we had one Tuesday, after the Week, we had two hours to organise what would they create as an presentation, as a document, and the second Tuesday, after the Week, it was the presentation itself.</Focus:content>

He was also helping a lot with trying to see, you know, that they can actually build their little models and all the idea about wind tunnel testing and so that these were locally developed at SLF.  n	And so it was also an interactive process, we then thought it would be good to involve the local energy company so we, since I already knew the CEO there so I asked him if he would come and give a lecture.

An important aspect is to have also the, I didn�t mention him yet, is the Spanish, Joseppe, architect, who is specialised in renewable and environmentally friendly buildings in an Alpine environment.  So he gives his lecture and shows his projects, Hendrik gives some basics on the physics of energy transfer and radiation.  And then we have architectural inputs and so this all gives them a first start-up which is finished in day one, day two, depending on how much we can do beforehand the changes from UTL a little bit.  n	And then in phase two is basically the students will develop then their own concepts with critique from us teachers, so we try to be very present in this phase to try to give them immediate feedback if they go in the wrong, in a direction which will not work very well for them.  But let them develop their concept with the, with a real task that every discipline is represented in the project, so the project should have an energy related part, a physics related part, an environmental related part, an economic part and an architectural part.  And so that�s a requirement and we also judge the initial ideas that they come up with, with respect, and then try to correct where it�s necessary. n	And then phase two is basically the development of their own concepts and already working out various calculations and trying to put a frame on it, structure their own project.  And then phase three is the main work part where they do either theoretically or work on data or they... In addition every project must have an experimental part, so they need to measure something, put their hands on something, either on a model and measure in a cold lab how the temperature decreases with a certain amount of heating or measure some radiation input as in a snowy environment, in a non-snowy environment, look at the differences and do things like that. </Focus:content>

So giving lectures first and then guiding and supervising the students in the practical application of these concepts there. nSo I actually also contributed, since I got involved the last year, proposing this new themes for this Semaine ENAC, of the design of the micro and temporary architecture. That was quite successful because the students found it very, yes, creative, something that you can once in a while go out of the box and invent something and try to, yes, like sort of exaggerate, but in good terms during this week. So also having some fun.nAnd for the rest the week is organised� Well, so some lectures� So there are four different teachers with four different lectures that teach different topics from environmental to economics and architecture, energy. Different aspects. And then we have the complementary supervision of these four teachers while guiding the students in developing their project.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en"> it�s trying to balancing theory and practical application of concept mainly. And so the way I proceed was to give a base of theoretical content at the beginning usually, so this is done normally one week before the real intense week in Davos. And in parallel there is also, I think this is very important, to give, to show case studies. So I think it�s important for the students to have reference of something that has been done in a sense, and that they can draw inspiration from.n	And then there is a first phase that is based on observation and discussion, but I would say limited discussion during the first brainstorming of the students among, in their groups. So I�m for giving some freedom in the students to really come up with their idea without influencing them too much, but still try to guide them and, yes, arise some discussion on their concept definition.n	Then there is a third phase of detailed supervision. So then you really can give some technical suggestions and guidance. n	And then there is also the experimental part, so they try to complement what they�re theoretically developing with some practical application. And as teachers we also try to accept their experiments and to guide them and to suggest some methodologies to optimise them.n	And then the final support in the finalisation of the project. n	So these are, I think, the five points of the teaching structure along the week.</Focus:content>

In Semaine ENAC, yes, I had, I knew that the Mishy [?] was the head of the Semaine ENAC because he was mainly in Davos, so he knew all the facilities in there, he�s responsible for what the students do also there, if there is something that doesn�t go well, it�s his responsibility.n	And then there is Hendrik [?], who is the core, I don�t know, supervisor of the whole group.

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">So normally we have the preparatory classes, they... Typically they are three, three hours and in these three hours we give an introduction like a global introduction of what the Semaine ENAC will be about.  This is after they have selected the Semaine ENAC because there is normally in December all the ENAC weeks are presented to all the students and then they make their choice and they get signed up.  And then they come in our Semaine ENAC and we do a kind of introduction to explain them what we are going to do, what is expected from them also.  And then we typically start to give them a common background that means a couple of lectures, well these are lectures but we try to keep them as interactive as possible.  That they can always ask their questions that it could even turn into a discussion while we still manage to give them all the information they need.  But it�s not a classical ex cathedra [?] to some extent yes because you know they are diverse and so we have to create a common base and then we go from there.  nSo that is the preparation and there is a lot of logistics in our case that has to be communicated.  Like because we are not on campus, like where to go, what to bring and so on.  This is... Should not be underestimated, I am typically taking care of all that, I have to say I�m taking care of a big part in terms of the preparation.

I do most of the logistics in terms of reservations, get the tickets and inform them.  Set up the Moodle site which is also another key word.</Focus:content>

And I think it�s also structured on the material limitations that they have to work with, in the sense that they first day they�re, you know, working with wood that they find in the forest.  nYou know, the second one they�re working with wood members that they�re just being introduced to, so something which is a totally new material.  And the third time they do the project, they�re working with material that�s a little bit more familiar to them, in that they�ve already done it once.  So you know, in that sense, these three sessions structure the hands on element.  nAnd I would say that the lectures, the two lectures that we did are, you know, come at the early part of the week to maybe put them in a mind-set that makes them a little critical of reflective of how they�re working.  So that they can not only do things and work together, but also maybe be in mind-set to kind of think about how they�re doing things, and think about how they�re working together.</Focus:content>

And then, yes, also put their hands on something is interesting, so the experience will be maybe their first time for them to try new tools. nYes, and I actually like the fact that they are going somewhere all together. Because this is� If they have to work in a group and this group has to be merged and uniform in a week, then it�s also nice that they are really also sleeping, eating all together. And this is contributing to their results, I think. It would be different if they were here and arriving at eight in the morning and then leaving at five, but it�s also nice that maybe they�re eating all together, they�re discussing about the project, that they say, oh, maybe we can do that or that.nSo that�s also something I like.

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">. I think the main interest or one of the main interests of the ENAC Week is it�s kind of time out, because architecture students especially, but perhaps the others, in Week they switch from course to the other, architects are very often, they�re very involved in the architectural projects and so it takes them a lot of time.  If you have one course [inaudible] from other courses in a teaching unit.n	If you have an afternoon, so they came at one o�clock, they work for you and then at four o�clock, five o�clock they say they�ve got a lot of things to do.  But the ENAC Week is kind of time out, so all the other things will stop so they can concentrate for four or five days only on one thing, one thing which is very interesting.  Because we had them for 100%, and they were engaged 100%.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content xml:lang="en">the first version was already quite successful.  n	And it seemed the key to success there was that we were available during the Week to guide the students in their individual development and steps, so we were sort of very closely following what they were actually doing.  And I think that�s a key for success in that particular format because if we give them the freedom then we want to make sure that they don�t run off doing something completely stupid, and then it�s important that you follow them closely during the Week. </Focus:content>
