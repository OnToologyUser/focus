Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Additional findings,"SP2	But what was also, sorry, what was also quite interesting is that we had a more architect than civil engineering actually in the...
SP1	Students.
SP2	Yes, from students and that is quite interesting because as the idea really was to work on the construction transformation.
SP1	Yes, yes, sure.
SP2	Concrete transformation of the containers it was quite interesting to I mean there were... The other professor were quite surprised to not to have so many students from the engineer side."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Additional findings,"But that was also part of the difficulty because you realise after two years for instance that in social sciences for instance we do have a much longer or much smooth rhythm of doing research.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	First of all because we also need to go inside of city to collect... To have data but also social sciences take more time to implement, to research, to... Because we need to check a lot of different factors which is the same also in engineering for sure.  But my experience or our experience on doing research in a multidisciplinary is that sometimes, not always in that was everyone of course.  But every topic or discipline but sometimes in engineer it’s much more... The speed is much more higher.
SP1	Yes, yes.
SP2	And here you do have some times of discrepancy between the rhythm, much more long, much more... I will not say deep because it’s not a question of deepness but it just... It’s another way of doing research.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And that is something that we experience a couple of time when we did some research for instance with engineer.
SP3	Yes.
SP2	For instance in social science you cannot have result after one month.
SP1	Yes, sure.
SP2	You need to do field work, you need to reflect on text, you need to organise a problematic, you need to understand so many vary other factors.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	But then again you need also to have another framework, a more general universal framework to see what are the differences and that takes times.
SP1	Yes, sure.
SP2	It’s not... And sometimes my... Our feeling was that was engineer as it is more sometimes based on modelling, on other types of experience you got result more quicker.  
SP1	Yes, okay.
SP2	And that can be sometimes more.."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Additional findings,"Yes Monique, you know Monique, she is new there, it’s the first time, it’s her first year, and it’s much more, much better than before.  
SP1	Okay, yes that’s something.
SP2	We have some people that are [inaudible] but not really well, because we had find ourselves where the rooms were to teach, [inaudible] they did not know how to do it really.  But Monique she is very engaged now, I told her for some things she had to pay attention and I think it’s okay now."
Michael Lehning (E11),Additional findings,"So think we have this true interdisciplinary ream where we have, first of all, you know, we are from the environmental sciences service, strong background in energy and mass transport questions, energy balance, everything that has to do with the physics of the earth surface.  That’s the key competence on the environmental sciences question, so we can measure heat fluxes with them, we can measure radiation transfer and explain them how diffuse or and direct radiation works and how that is reflected by the snow surface.  
	Things like that are key competences and then we combine that with the competence on how to actually construct and design buildings, also from an energy point of view."
Michael Lehning (E11),Additional findings,"And so you’re an expert what would you advise for some newcomers, what do they need to develop their own week?
SP2	I think what worked also in the early phases of the development of the week was that you had an idea, but then the idea was flexible and could be adjusted to the team.  And that’s also what we realised, so when we had, as I said, this Wim van der Hoede [?] who was quite essential in the initial setup of the project, he brought in more architectural aspects for very small models, so it was important for him to look at the structural properties of these models.  
	And so you have to, I think the recipe for success is get a good, it’s like always, get a good team and then, you know, and then see where is the compromise between the team and the original idea.  And then let the thing evolve."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Additional findings,"what do newcomers need to develop their own new ENAC week? Just from your experience, what are the most important things?
SP2	Yes, willing to go out of the box, I would say, to really think differently for a certain period of the year, and… But I think time… Like getting more and more aware that this is where the future of the built environment especially will be. I mean this is really applicable, I think, to any field, but especially if we talk about transformation of the built environment, this is essential to understand. So I think people have to be ready to put themselves in discussions somehow and say, okay, we’re going to learn something new and we can really then apply this new learning in our teaching experience, in our supervision of students, and in our own research."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Additional findings,"well, from my side I could say that after two years I’m much more involved into the project, so I know what to expect also from the students. And to me it was much more easier to follow the projects, and I guess for next year will be even easier if I would ever be there.
	And the highlight in general, I think that this year they were much more creative than last year, but it does depends on other thing, it’s a… Because it depends on the students, so it’s a group of people that really work well together, that’s not our [inaudible] but it’s…
SP1	You never know.
SP2	Yes, but anyway… Yes, maybe also we as a group, because it was the second year working together, we were much more on the same wave, let’s say, so we were thinking the same thing, and so probably we were guiding better the groups. And then at the end the results were quite nice, I think, satisfactory. Yes."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Additional findings,"So maybe the content should be… Because I know that some week are just, are mainly focusing on architecture, so probably they should try to have a content which is interesting for the three schools, and that is fundamental also for the students to be involved in the projects. And then, yes, also put their hands on something is interesting, so the experience will be maybe their first time for them to try new tools. 
Yes, and I actually like the fact that they are going somewhere all together. Because this is… If they have to work in a group and this group has to be merged and uniform in a week, then it’s also nice that they are really also sleeping, eating all together. And this is contributing to their results, I think. It would be different if they were here and arriving at eight in the morning and then leaving at five, but it’s also nice that maybe they’re eating all together, they’re discussing about the project, that they say, oh, maybe we can do that or that.
So that’s also something I like. I don’t know if it’s possible to, for the new weeks to go somewhere"
Philippe Belanger (E13),Additional findings,"But about advice for other weeks, just, I mean, there is no… I don’t think there is a recipe of the working Semaine ENAC.  I mean, the secret of the success, I think, is a lot about the team that we manage to have.  Me, Hendrik, Josep, Michy all together with Parag at the beginning, which has been replaced by Luisa and Giorgia.  Which took the huge shoes that Parag left and filled them really nice.  Luisa and Giorgia arrived with the idea of temporary design, that was their contribution at the beginning, and I really think that they are able to bring it at the new… At a nice level.  So the fact that they are talking about leaving next year, it’s kind of, okay… It’s not as I’ve used that… Will have the same chemistry with the newcomers because that’s a huge part."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Additional findings,"So I think that this mix-up and this synergy that we have altogether is the secret of the success, and the fact that we can ask so much to the student and they are still get out of the Semaine ENAC like with the [non-English], that they have realised something.  So they have learned something also, so it’s really… I mean, the fact that we are able to get all this thing that are not as easily put together, together is really the chemistry of the thing.  We are able to… Hendrik goes in with a theme, I go in right after, and there is no… There is, kind of, even though we don’t have the same paradigm, we don’t have the same approach, there is no clash, there is no… Everything, like, fits together like a well oiled mechanism."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Additional findings,"Some people also talk about transdisciplinary, I don’t really see like what’s the difference between the two but..."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Additional findings,"I think there are two key points, one is a good competent and interdisciplinary team of motivated people, if people do a Semaine ENAC because it is a duty and they... It’s you know, imposed as their teaching itinerary and motivation will be lower.  The second point is I think to really think about a good topic that attracts the students."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Additional findings,"So I think spent really a lot of time for a good concept that attracts the students from all sections.  I think it’s also important that it’s broad enough that you don’t have only one part, like only civil engineers coming because you are a I don’t know, checking stability of bridges or whatever.  This is important, I think that’s the base for success of a Semaine ENAC that the topic is attractive and I think it’s not a huge problem if it is partly redundant with what already exists. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Additional findings,"Fred was also taking part.  There were also two of my colleagues from the architecture department.  And then, we had interventions from people in the concrete lab, and also in the steel lab on the [inaudible].  So those were more like, you know, one-hour interventions.  
We also had an intervention on glass as a structural kind of element.  Someone at [inaudible] was doing testing with the structural glass. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Additional findings," in terms of kind of teaching, I guess, you know, it was the three of us from ALIS, which is one of the architectural laboratories.  And then, Fred from EBAW [?], who was also kind of, you know, helped us to organise the spaces that we worked in, which was actually very important to have that space."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Additional findings,"all of us were, for example, you know, scientific collaborators"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Additional findings,"we sort of had architects, civil engineers and environmental engineers, so they were in their second year.  And so, you know, we think, okay, they should work together to build this project, but actually they don’t have so much background in their field."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Additional findings," basically they never heard anything about water treatment; they probably didn’t have a lot of information on, you know, statics [?] for construction of buildings and things like that."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Additional findings,"So you have to teach them very quickly; in a few hours you have to teach them basics of, in my case, of water treatment and waste water management.  And so they’re, you know, they’re like, almost like beginners, you know.  And then you say, okay, now you’re the expert on water; you have to solve this problem.  So I think, from that point of view, in my opinion, it’s almost a little bit too early in the curriculum."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Additional findings,"they have minimal knowledge on the topics they should work on.  Maybe it’s different in others, Semaine ENACs. But in my case, you know, in my specific field, I know I teach these students in the Master course these, the competence that they would need for the Semaine ENAC.  So I think then you basically just have to teach them in a few hours what they need to know, and after that you basically leave them to…  But you have to help them, of course, quite a lot to work on this projec"
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,"Now, I think that the EPFL students, they get well trained in solving differential equations.  I’m not convinced that many of the EPFL students are well trained to address complex problems in a more practical framework, outside of the mathematics, etc., etc."
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,"I’m not convinced that they are mature enough to become fully exposed, and to become pulled through a kind of interdisciplinary project within five days.  I don’t think so. "
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,increase the visibility of the faculty within the EPFL. 
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,"I don’t know.  I’m not a good person to ask.  No, I’m sorry.  I’m not familiar enough with the teaching.  I’m teaching, but I’m not familiar enough with the curricula, etc., etc. to give a kind of a well-informed answer on this, I’m sorry. "
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings," even don’t know the topics of the other Semaine ENACs.  You know, so I would need to know the topics of the other Semaine ENACs better. Plus, I would have to be better familiar with the Bachelor’s curricula, etc.  No, it’s hard"
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,"To actively participate with Semaine ENAC, and Semaine means a weeks’ work.  And many professors, you know, either they are very busy, or they have an ego, you know, that is too large, right?  So that because, you know, teaching your own class to students, you know, you try to kind of impart your fingerprint onto the brain of the student.  And you can do this week by week by week by week. "
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,e ego of some of my colleagues may also kind of suffer from this.
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,how many professors [inaudible] really take part with Semaine ENAC?  And how many hours do they really stay with the students during one Semaine ENAC?  
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,I’m not aware of anybody who this year participated to Semaine ENAC.  
Tom Battin (E16),Additional findings,"It’s also a question of how far do I identify myself with this kind of interdisciplinary work because interdisciplinary work very often, it’s becoming something watery.  And you know, so what is the benefit I have from that?"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Additional findings,"And so they are supposed to be the engineers, you know, in [unclear], but at that level of [unclear], they are not strong enough. So it’s true, the presence of a professor which is a certain way re-assessing the importance of the… And speaking as an engineer, a civil engineer, environmental science."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Additional findings,"And then environmental science, they had a professor and, but they always are very few of them, with only four that "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Additional findings,"Because there are less, I think, in general as, in cooperation [?] with architect students and civil engineers. And then maybe that there are some weeks, I think there are more of them. I don’t know if the representation we have, it’s an under representation or it’s just right presentation, but I believe there are some weeks which are very, over representation. But it has to do with who is teaching, you know, and [unclear] saying about who is professor, I need [unclear]. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Additional findings,"I don’t have the exact picture of it, but in a certain way I’m not sure that there are so many ordinary professor involved in ENAC week."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Additional findings,"SP2	That’s part of your teaching. Otherwise, I think there is no specific qualification, except this willingness to interact with the students in a formal, informal way during a Week, and to have… Yes, you need to have cool questions to propose. I mean, obviously, you will always only be satisfied if the students are motivated to work, but that shouldn’t be too complicated. Yes. I mean, myself, I got involved because they asked me. I didn’t ask myself, like, oh, what does it mean?"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Additional findings,"nly thing I know is it’s really this time where I don’t do anything else, which is not necessarily closely related to my everyday work"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Additional findings,to my background and my personal experience
Michael Lehning (E11),Appreciation of own engagement,"Right and so how is this ENAC week positioned kind of in the plan for your institute, kind of where is it, is it like a normal teaching task or is something additional or how is it seen?
SP2	Actually I don’t know, I would have to ask Francoise for that, but I think it’s mandatory, it’s a mandatory part."
Michael Lehning (E11),Appreciation of own engagement,"Coming back to the bannering [?] of your engagement, how is it seen from your colleagues, let’s say in the lab, well, but also at the institute level?
SP2	No I think everybody is, almost everybody is involved in some form in one of these, in these inter-disciplinary teaching tasks there is other formats, [inaudible] is not the only one.  But I think everybody has something, and so think this already shows that it’s very well valued also by colleagues, that it’s probably a good experience for a majority of the faculty."
Michael Lehning (E11),Appreciation of own engagement,"I think, as I said earlier, I was solicited to start that by the former Dean and I feel that also the new Dean sees that as a very important tool.  The new Dean was basically a founding member of [inaudible], is stil strongly supporting that."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Appreciation of own engagement," how is it valued? Are your colleagues…? Your engagement in this ENAC week, by your colleagues and also by Marilyne?
SP2	As the other teaching courses, I would say. 
SP1	Kind of…
SP2	Not… Yes. Equally.
SP1	Not really more…
SP2	More or less, no. I think, yes, equally. There’s no particular emphasis on that and, yes…
SP1	It’s not really…?"
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Appreciation of own engagement,"Yes, not all the PhD are teaching, so it’s a choice of the PhD if they want to teach in the future, then they choose to teach or not. For example, we as LIPID, as a laboratory, we’re… We don’t have many courses, we have, I think, three or four, and I’m teaching two, so I am one of the people that really want to teach in the future, but it’s really up to me and it’s not recognised. I mean it’s recognised that I’m teaching there from credits, but yes, if I don’t do that, I don’t lose anything, and if I do that, I don’t gain anything. It’s just for, yes, my own path since I would be, I want to teach at university, it’s just a good training for me."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Appreciation of own engagement,"SP1	No, of course. And so this ENAC week is not really kind of same level as normal courses, it’s kind of extra and…
SP2	But… No. To me it’s the same level as a normal course.
SP1	So for you personal, but for the institute it’s not.
SP2	Also, yes.
SP1	It’s the same?
SP2	Yes."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Appreciation of own engagement,"How is this specific ENAC week valued by your colleagues and your supervisors, so by Marilyne?
SP2	So how was…?
SP1	Your engagement in this ENAC week, how was it valued?
SP2	By Marilyne, or…?
SP1	Yes, and your colleagues.
SP2	I think it’s like the other courses, it’s like being involved in the other courses, it’s just instead of being the [inaudible] semester, it’s just one intense week. So, and also for Marilyne, it’s a day, week three, this Semaine ENAC, are really at the same level of the others, of the other courses."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Appreciation of own engagement,"I mean in our group, in CRYOS the Semaine ENAC has some visibility, people know that we are doing that, we mention that in the group meetings and so on.  Apart from Mihi and me nobody else is involved in the teaching but also the say some of the PhD students that are here with us they have been students in environmental engineering or in ENAC.  They know the Semaine ENAC and I would say this is appreciated but there is not... No need to involve them much more in this.  At the institute level I think it’s appreciated that people do it"
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Appreciation of own engagement," If we are talking about the section they are basically managing the teaching, they are usually happy.  If people are involved you know it’s part of our job, it’s... So the section is very favourable to this and there is also no... Not really, well there may be competition in a sense that you say I have already four lectures and I don’t have time to do a Semaine ENAC.  Or the other way around, you really do a Semaine ENAC fully involved and then you say okay, then I cannot do my fourth lecture anymore or an additional one.  This is also something that section has to realise that there are limits."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Appreciation of own engagement,"And finally at the ENAC level I mean since two years there is a bit I would say a revival of Semaine ENAC also strongly pushed from the dean’s office and I know this from personal experience.  Because until last year I was in the dean’s office for six years and I followed this process quite a bit.  There was also two years... Was it two years ago?  No, for the last year edition some the budget for you know what they called high potential Semaine ENAC so there was an additional budget to get I don’t know, buy equipment or improve the existing Semaine ENAC or to create new ones.  And so there were a couple of incentives to promote this and now I would say with the succession of Jean d’Anie [?] who did the Jean d’Anie [inaudible], who did the [inaudible] before now with Monique there is a new dynamic.  And I think people start to feel that it is... That the whole concept of Projeter d'Ensemble is supported and carried by ENAC, by direction of ENAC as well.  
And what’s still not completely clear is the valorisation and appreciation of those who are really involved and engaged that you know, sometimes it’s... Some colleagues still consider it as not really as hard science and like a... If you want to really be nasty and a waste of time for like a bit of... A week of blah blah and we are really motivated to change this image and I think our Semaine ENAC is fairly substantial.  It’s calculation, it’s design, it’s involvement, I think it is... It has a solid engineering background."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Appreciation of own engagement,"we’re scientific collaborators.  So you know, our percentage wasn’t raised because we did all that extra work.  
We had to juggle between our regular teaching and this.  And we did it really because we wanted to.  And there was no other kind of recognition of the fact that we were putting in that extra time, and that extra effort, or anything like that. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Appreciation of own engagement,"this year, I had the luxury of getting my ticket paid, and some time paid.  But you know, Fred certainly didn’t.  And so you know, in that sense, you know, I don’t know how valued it is by the school.  I think it would help a great deal if there was some recognition of the fact that it is a significant, or can be a commitment of time and energy. "
Tom Battin (E16),Appreciation of own engagement,"To actively participate with Semaine ENAC, and Semaine means a weeks’ work.  And many professors, you know, either they are very busy, or they have an ego, you know, that is too large, right?  So that because, you know, teaching your own class to students, you know, you try to kind of impart your fingerprint onto the brain of the student.  And you can do this week by week by week by week. "
Tom Battin (E16),Appreciation of own engagement,"erall I found that for the overall level of this Semaine, and Semaine [inaudible] ENAC that, you know, where I got some feedback from, is relatively low.  It’s relatively low.  And I wonder whether that’s good, also like, for the future of the Semaine ENAC because obviously, EPFL wants to hit high.  So we should hit high with the Semaine ENACs, as well. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Appreciation of own engagement,"It would be interesting just to decompose who carried on and what their academic [?] [unclear]. And otherwise I know we have [unclear] a strong support from our dean, and so yes, the fact that we have 12,000 SFr around, which is, that’s convenient and it’s well appreciated."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Appreciation of own engagement,"And so the financial support is nice and yes, I think it will gain is it’s really valued as a [unclear] tool, which is important in the [inaudible]. "
Derek Christie (E3),Appreciation of own engagement,"I think it is valued: we do get support.  I think it’s not valued enough: we don't get enough support, but there is some.  I think it would be necessary to improve the visibility of the ENAC week somehow.  And I don't know if it should be an ENAC week or if it should be something, as we said before, a bit more spread out.  Which... perhaps not over the whole year, but maybe one semester or half a semester, I don't know.  Maybe some thought has to be given to what format it should have, because I think the format does have an effect on how it’s viewed and valued by the students, the teachers and everybody else."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,"nly thing I know is it’s really this time where I don’t do anything else, which is not necessarily closely related to my everyday work"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,"Well, I was… I had a superior until December 2015. I didn’t have the impression that it was really something important."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,"SP2	I mean, it was just happening. Some people didn’t go to final presentations or things. It was really happening in some parallel underground world, say."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,"For most colleagues, they had not a single idea what was happening there, especially my colleague… "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,"But all the others, they have never heard of it. And they get the invitation to see something, so they don’t even have an idea what it is."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,it’s not present at all. It was present in the years when my superior had his own Week.
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Appreciation of own engagement,"it was present for him, but then the rest of the colleagues still didn’t know what it actually is, so… But it’s like most teaching stuff, actually. It’s happening in parallel… To do research and… Yes. It’s certainly not something that is particularly present, but it’s just like all classes."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"Perhaps we had too much things, some students had been a little bit frustrated because they had to stay in classroom to make urban parts of the project, so they couldn’t participate on the work on the building. "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"For them perhaps they did not spend so much time to think about what they can bring [inaudible] you go there and then you maybe will see what’s actually happening.
SP1	Okay.  
SP2	But the engagement was, from some people, the engagement was not so very intensive, so..."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"Sure, that it’s very human resources intensive…
SP1	It is, yes.
SP2	They only have one professor for four students, but I mean, I think the value is there, too."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"the thing maybe that I felt like I, or we, was lacking, was really kind of a network in that sense."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"in terms of the planning, in my opinion, it could have been a little bit better in the organisation"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week, it could have been a little bit better in terms of the organisation.  I think the students could have profited more.
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"this interactive part could have been stronger, yes, in this Week if we would have had more time to organise it."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"the core should be better defined in terms of the goal, yes, what should come out of it from the beginning and…  I mean, it was a little bit, in terms of the organisation, it was sometimes a little bit improvised, yes: okay, now we do this or that, but…!"
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"is they were not prepared enough to work in an interdisciplinary, or a multi-disciplinary setting.  So they were not prepared to do so, right?  And that was also part of the critiques that we got back from the students.  But that’s relatively easy to fix for next year. "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week," Oh, there was nothing in there from civil engineering, when nobody cares about because it’s about interdisciplinary.  So they need to get better preparation here, plus, I think they need… "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week," They need to get, like, trained in soft skills.  Like, for instance, presenting, you know, what they did, for instance, on the one hand.  So really, like, presentation skills, but also skills in writing, etc., etc. "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"Unfortunately, this must be outside.  This must happen before because Semaine ENAC is really short.  It’s extremely short, and even way too short, right?  And we all know that, like, interdisciplinary work, it takes a while, you know? "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"rom some of the presentations during the final plenum lectures there.  I didn’t feel the interdisciplinary there.  No, but I mean, this kind of training in soft skills cannot be part of that week. "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"So there was within, throughout week, a kind of gap almost between that community from Geneva and the EPFL community, unfortunately.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"I saw many unhappy and tired faces, etc., etc.  So it’s like, I think there would be ways to kind of increase the happiness of the students, and also of the teachers, actually, by having perhaps even smaller groups perhaps, better focused subjects."
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week," I was really shocked during some of these presentations.  I was really shocked, gosh, you know, I mean, those that were a little bit closer to my field, you know"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week," input, of theoretical [?] input to do it. We’ve probably done a little bit too much of that. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"students can be quite easily, yes, challenged and they can be kind of harsh in the evaluation. We had this questionnaire [unclear] evaluation. We’re not so glad with the evaluation of the week."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"just criticising some of lack of organisation, which is… Yes. There are a couple of things were not so smooth, but total we had places to walk, we had a roundtable, we had… So it’s really… Yes, and it’s, that’s interesting as a critique. And then, but it’s annoying to receive it because the people worked hard to organise it."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"it was maybe too much work and the students were, at one point, a big lost [?]. They started too late to be working really on the core [?] of their… And that’s, I think that’s an important point, and… "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"Because there are less, I think, in general as, in cooperation [?] with architect students and civil engineers. And then maybe that there are some weeks, I think there are more of them. I don’t know if the representation we have, it’s an under representation or it’s just right presentation, but I believe there are some weeks which are very, over representation. But it has to do with who is teaching, you know, and [unclear] saying about who is professor, I need [unclear]. "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"The too-short period. So as I said before, on one hand, for the students it’s great because they have to learn to provide output in time. And on the other hand, they always feel frustrated. So they’re very motivated and then they feel frustrated."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Assessment of the week\Negative assessment of the week,"they have a meeting before to prepare, but obviously this meeting is just to get to know each other. So… And spending more time on preparation is not the solution, because what makes the whole dynamic is to be together during a week."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So I think this also raised among our students the interest of being part of this project.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	Yes.
SP3	Because they saw or they knew that that could be a possible really implementation on site.
SP1	Which would lead to something bigger."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"SP2	So in a way from that first interest pop up others interest from student, that was quite interesting as well."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"But also this year a couple of student told us that they heard from last year that the Semaine ENAC was really nice.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	They enjoy very much and that’s always a positive, you know, feeling."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"Yes, yes, it was really great actually, it works very well.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And it was beautiful because we had nice... It was summertime this year."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So do you think it’s very important that something like the ENAC week is a part of the curriculum of the students?
SP2	Yes.
SP1	So you think it’s a good thing...
SP3	Definitely.
SP2	Yes, yes, absolutely."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"P2	But I think it’s a good idea, really, I don’t know if other faculties are doing also a week of working together really and I think that’s a very good idea.  And I think it is a very good concept that has... Should be implemented in other faculties really because I think it’s a very good idea.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And for that I think it will be... I don’t know if the CDH is the only one... Other faculties involved in Semaine ENAC but it could be interesting also to look at others teaching staff."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"My sense is that what makes it interesting both for the students and for us is that we are working on something concrete.  Either a concrete problem, issue, can be I think an issue of water and ENAC weeks are very diverse.  But still I mean there is a core theme that federates the interest of various scholars and different disciplines."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,working in a broad team both of faculty wise but also students wise on a concrete issue...
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I think it’s very a nice occasion to learn more about student.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	Because you are I mean if you have regular class once a week you just see your students two hours.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And you don’t have others... I mean you can have but it’s not common to build other relation or you know, with students."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"But I think you... It is a moment where you better understand the needs of the students, you better understand what they are waiting for.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	Studies for instance, what are the main problem.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	It’s really kind of immersion from both side, I mean from the faculties and from the students.
SP1	Yes, yes.
SP2	And I think as a teacher is very interesting to get closer to them..."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"SP2	And I think then it’s in terms of teaching them of providing them teaching or to discuss issues with them when you have an exam or when you have... They have to give us a essay it’s much more easy and you can go much more deeper as well."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"Yes the highlight is that we were really working on a real building with real materials, this is really the highlight of it. "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week," But otherwise I think, from my point of view, the organisation, spending one day to make specialists, one day to make a project and then three days to do the building it’s not so bad.  "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,". I think the main interest or one of the main interests of the ENAC Week is it’s kind of time out, because architecture students especially, but perhaps the others, in Week they switch from course to the other, architects are very often, they’re very involved in the architectural projects and so it takes them a lot of time.  If you have one course [inaudible] from other courses in a teaching unit.
	If you have an afternoon, so they came at one o’clock, they work for you and then at four o’clock, five o’clock they say they’ve got a lot of things to do.  But the ENAC Week is kind of time out, so all the other things will stop so they can concentrate for four or five days only on one thing, one thing which is very interesting.  Because we had them for 100%, and they were engaged 100%."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I think it’s very interesting as a teacher because you can do a thing, it’s a very short time but you can, you have them for 100% and you can do things that you cannot do while they’re in other courses."
Michael Lehning (E11),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"the first version was already quite successful.  
	And it seemed the key to success there was that we were available during the Week to guide the students in their individual development and steps, so we were sort of very closely following what they were actually doing.  And I think that’s a key for success in that particular format because if we give them the freedom then we want to make sure that they don’t run off doing something completely stupid, and then it’s important that you follow them closely during the Week. "
Michael Lehning (E11),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So this last year’s week I think was... The lessons that we learn every year is that it works actually, so the students are typically engaged, highly motivated and they produce some remarkable results there in this short amount of time.  It’s also true that the amount of creativity or good ideas is limited, so we see that similar ideas pop up every year, which is also natural, that’s not a problem, so that’s another lesson.  "
Michael Lehning (E11),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I think it’s an important part of the Bachelor curriculum, so it’s important for the students, but it’s also important for us because it is the first contact with the students and a quite close contact, so they get to see us in an environment that is much more relaxed and if they have to deal with my radiation transfer modelling in the atmosphere which makes them a little bit tight sometimes, and so I think it’s good, it’s good for both sides, yes I’m a real supporter of that idea"
Michael Lehning (E11),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"Yes I think, as I said, you know, it’s the first early contact with the students in a fairly relaxed environment.  I think it is very useful, so I perceive our role as professors as really also to teach to students something that they can use, and I think in that respect I feel that this format is quite effective in actually doing this. Because it’s very close to real life projects, they have a limited amount of time and they need to produce a result in a week, that is new to them and that is..."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And what were the highlights of the week for you?
SP2	I think the enthusiasm of the students in discovering for the first time what is working in a, yes, multidisciplinary environment and getting to find compromise with other people working in different fields. So trying to… Looking at the effort that they made together, but then, yes, see that they’re happy with their results, and this is what we saw with the final presentations, so…"
Luisa Pastore (E9),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I don’t know. I had fun, I was… I really enjoyed it. It’s one of the few occasion you have in teaching where you can be in touch with different people from different backgrounds, so this is something I really like. And I like learning about it again, I mean, I really like to always consider myself as a small portion of our broader system, and so… And how to interact, how I have to learn to interact with all the rest. I think this is essential, again both at professional, research, and then again, teaching field, so… Yes."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And I think next year there will be a change in the PhD students, so there will be another PhD student here who wants to join. So I don’t know if I will go on, I would really like to but I understand that I also… Since I’ve done it already for two years, it’s also time for me to give my place to someone else to enjoy the Semaine ENAC."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So in general I think it’s a good structure. Of course, I preferred last year but this year we could have the possibility to do differently, so it’s okay."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And I think also they express that in the evaluation they gave, so they are always really happy about the Semaine ENAC, Davos. I don’t know about the others, but probably… They are always complaining about the amount of work they have, but I think, I mean, I don’t know. They also have fun kind of designing the project together, it could be also fun."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I think that this year they were much more creative than last year, but it does depends on other thing, it’s a… Because it depends on the students, so it’s a group of people that really work well together, that’s not our [inaudible] but it’s…
SP1	You never know.
SP2	Yes, but anyway… Yes, maybe also we as a group, because it was the second year working together, we were much more on the same wave, let’s say, so we were thinking the same thing, and so probably we were guiding better the groups. And then at the end the results were quite nice, I think, satisfactory. Yes."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So it’s appreciated from the students, and I saw some students after the first few Semaine ENAC and they told me, you know, most of the thing that we see in this week, we already saw it in other courses or we see it after in other courses.  But the finance and economic thing, we don’t see it anywhere.  So the only thing that is unique on the Semaine ENAC is the economic part."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So, kind of, the methods used and the didactical structure of the week, how do you see it?
SP2	I really like it.  I mean, I would change nothing.  Maybe, like we had before the week of the one session of teaching before, but the idea… I would like to be able to do that in my classes, have classes like that in my university.  I would really like to have that kind of teaching.  Like, I mean, in some business schools it’s the usual kind of teaching, like you have… Well, it’s not… It’s more formal but it’s, you have a case study and you have to solve the case and then you present your solution and the professor helps you to, like, figure out what you need to do to improve your solution.  "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I really like this approach and I would change nothing.  I mean, and I think that the students like it too.  It’s different from magistral courses."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So I think that this mix-up and this synergy that we have altogether is the secret of the success, and the fact that we can ask so much to the student and they are still get out of the Semaine ENAC like with the [non-English], that they have realised something.  So they have learned something also, so it’s really… I mean, the fact that we are able to get all this thing that are not as easily put together, together is really the chemistry of the thing.  We are able to… Hendrik goes in with a theme, I go in right after, and there is no… There is, kind of, even though we don’t have the same paradigm, we don’t have the same approach, there is no clash, there is no… Everything, like, fits together like a well oiled mechanism."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"So it has its own dynamic I would say and in the meantime we also have as you noticed from the other discussions we have our reputation.  It’s a reputation is that it’s a work intensive week and this is wanted.  I mean up to the point that they start to mention to workload that is at the limit but we almost want it this way.  Because our goal is that they learn something, it should not be a wasted week where they do nothing."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"Okay, well this year was a very positive experience, we had a motivated group of students which always helps to the things go fairly easy and so they were productive, they were interested, they were listening, the overall atmosphere was nice.  I can’t think of much negative of this year so the whole teaching team was anonymously saying that was a great week.  And of course we can compare to previous years, we never had a disaster"
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"No.
SP2	But I think overall there is definitely a positive feedback, you know the projects of the students, what they have done.  You know also where difficulties were encountered in terms of feasibility of projects, I think you also get a good sense of judging what kind of project is possible in a given timeframe.  That is I think that can be translated to same as the projects or master projects that you can define a project for a student that is challenging but still feasible.  And not after three months you realise oh, this was only the introduction and there is no time to do the core of the work.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	So I think that is nice and then it also opens a bit perspectives for your own research that you know also other colleagues, you know their work and I think if need be you could integrate elements from this experience.  And use the network of the Semaine ENAC to incorporate or to link your work or elements of their work with what you are doing.
SP1	So for your own interdisciplinary work if you like.
SP2	And finally it also helps for teaching other classes I think you can always make reference to a... To these things or bringing examples from Semaine ENAC."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"the students and their feedback, in the sense that they appreciated very much the chance not to be in the classroom, and to be working together"
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"we never had any problems kind of, you know, having the students there and working.  They really appreciated that.  So I think we this year, gave them even more time in some sense."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week," I think both this year and last we were amazed that it kind of worked in the sense that at the end some of them make really nice tables, you know?  And this year, too, I was, you know, pleasantly surprised because it did feel kind of less structured than perhaps I had hoped. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week," somehow the students seemed to work together, and learn at least in terms of the kind of making and putting this material together to do what it’s supposed to do.  But they actually, you know, are able to do that in a very short period of time.  And you know, in that sense it’s kind of a surprise, and a nice surprise, and a success in some ways."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And the engineering students always say that.  They always say, you know, we never have classes like this.  So for us it was fun, you know? "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week," I do think we have the luxury of having the students together for one week, where they don’t have anything else to do, which is really fantastic"
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And I really, you know, think that it’s a great thing that it’s an intensive week like that"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"some comments of the students were also that they really appreciated it to have something more concrete once, and also, I mean, the interaction with the professors is more intense than in a course…"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I personally find it’s quite...  I found it quite rewarding to do it,"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"Despite all the, you know, negative points that I mentioned, I think – you know, one could optimise it, but I think it’s still quite rewarding to do it, and also to have a more close contact with the students for a week"
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"I mean, overall, I’m a big fan of the Semaine ENAC.  And I mean, I learned a lot.  Personally, I learned a whole lot, you know?  But it requires more meetings with the students, more work upstream before we start it. "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"ow sociologists, how they think about what I’m working on, right?  So the same for those people working in landscape, whatever it is, it’s not landscape ecology.  But it’s like, I don’t know, it’s landscaping or urbanism and city interface, right?  "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"But it’s completely different approaches, actually, which I find really intriguing, and even asking slightly different questions.  I learned a lot of from the artists, [inaudible].  So the way they perceived their watery environment, for instance, or the alpine environment. "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"for me that was really kind of enriching, very much, yes.  It was quite a beautiful experience.  I mean, not only like, when it comes to the content.  But also, like, the way they interacted with the students, even, completely different from what I’ve been doing in my past career in Austria, but also here"
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"SP2	Well, I think the basic structure is great.  You know, so like, the basic structure, but that’s also like, it’s a must.  Otherwise, they wouldn’t get to the information they require to do the actual work, you know?  "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"It’s like, the very close and continuous contact between the students and the teachers.  So that’s also great.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"But that means that we are, you know, at their full disposal, you know?  Whenever they need something they should come and ask this fucking question, right, and to interact with us.  "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"the final results are quite exciting. I think that they come up as the other week, we… Actually it’s true. We asked them to work quite strongly on the project, and, but they get back… They gave, they turned in some good reports. No, I don’t know what to call them. But yes, they really…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"hen you have kind of a stimulating image for this question of territorial landscaping, social and political ecological [?] question. And it’s quite… Yes, there’s lots of elements. So I think in that sense it’s quite successful. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"for the teaching team also, it was kind of stimulating. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"Though there was a couple of very well, very good successes. And, but with the teaching team, it was, it’s always, those weeks are always, I think, very enjoyable, but also very rich [?] in the type of link you make with your colleagues."
Derek Christie (E3),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And I saw a really good evolution from 2015 to 2016 – it worked a lot better.  The reviews we got from the students, as far as I know, are a lot better.  At least the informal feedback we got, was a lot better."
Derek Christie (E3),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"about this set up is, we do have a lot of flexibility; we’re able to adapt from one year to the next. "
Derek Christie (E3),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"And this year, it worked out very well because they're all very motivated and they created a lot of stuff.  Some of the stuff was not really what I was expecting in my group.  I was a bit disappointed on some things, but they did other things which I was not expecting.  So, I'm beginning to accept this idea of, kind of, handing the keys over to the students a bit more. "
Derek Christie (E3),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"The [unclear] students this year, definitely had it.  For them it’s no problem to... to draw a map and say: we want a bridge over the motorway because this is where this is going to go.  They didn’t actually do it, but if we’d said, you know: can you please tell us the width, the breadth, the material, the calculations, and statics, whatever, I’m sure they would have done it: it would have been no problem.  So, I think they’re very open. "
Derek Christie (E3),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,"They... they... one of them even said, when we had our debriefing meeting, they said: you know, we didn’t feel that we were sitting in the meeting with architect written on our heads or something."
Derek Christie (E3),Assessment of the week\Positive assessment of the week,the students were happy; we were happy; the people we presented the work to were interested in what was done. 
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"SP2	I think the most important things they have to learn during that week is to... Is to read text, to understand what is the context of the text.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	The content, sorry, of the text and then to communicate to the others.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	So how they can from our side or to us really synthesise idea and try to explain to the others."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,So they can be understood from the others so the others can learn also from them and then the communication is kind of knowledge building altogether in a way.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"And I think that is something very important they need to learn and also to understand the multidisciplinary... What is multidisciplinary actually?
SP1	Yes.
SP2	What is behind this word of inter or multi or transmultidisciplinary and for them they need to understand that there are different tools.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	There are different discipline use to explain a context, a situation or a problematic."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"SP2	Or [inaudible] and how then they try to merge different tools to make it something coherent at the end."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,I would say first encourage the students to contextualise both the problems and the projects.  So contextualise the problem of finding a solution for post disaster for example
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"I would say our objective with that... The students get sensitised of how to work on a technical dimension locating the problem and the projects as I said before in its broader social cultural context.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	So it’s related to the first one but it’s a bit... This thing I mean in that sense we highlight the fact that technical competencies and the skills need to be adapted.
SP1	Yes.
SP3	And to be thought of in their broader context...
SP1	Sure, in a more systemic context."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences, how to work in a team.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"So typically on the construction side how to define the roles, how to you know act in a most efficient and collaborative way, I think this would be my third.
SP1	Yes and also between disciplines"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"I think one of the important word here maybe is the word of reflexivity as well.
SP1	Okay."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"Yes, and it’s also the reflexivity between disciplines maybe that...
SP2	Yes.
SP1	You get an understanding of how you frame problems from your own perspective.
SP3	Exactly.
SP2	Exactly.
SP1	And reflect upon it and how others do it and so..."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,"Because also it help the students, that is something very interesting we observed this year.  There were some students working in civil engineer and they wanted to change to architecture for instance because of the work together they know... I mean they learn to know what other faculties, engineer in there until then.  And civil engineer, environmental engineer and architect were doing.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And they were entrusting on other’s methodology, on other’s tools and I think that is something very nice also to give the students at the second year this opportunity to share their knowledge."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Competences,e ENAC weeks is possibility given to the students to go beyond their own field and discipline of socialisation.
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Competences,"One of the things is that they should practice what they usually apply only in theoretical courses, just as one main issue is really to handle tools and to like make a project but not only, to also calculate it, but also to build it at the end, which is where, for me just, from my experience it was really not so easy for them.  Because they did not even know the names of basic tools, so I think from this point they learnt a lot.  
	And then the second thing was to have to work together, and they learnt how the architects worked, how civil engineering are thinking and working and some of the other side they had to help them, because architects they can, they do drawings so they draw for civil engineers, and civil engineers help architects to design structures.  So from this point of view it was really an exchange"
Michael Lehning (E11),Competences," And what do you think about the competences in this and ENAC, which are the key competences, your top?
SP2	So think we have this true interdisciplinary ream where we have, first of all, you know, we are from the environmental sciences service, strong background in energy and mass transport questions, energy balance, everything that has to do with the physics of the earth surface.  That’s the key competence on the environmental sciences question, so we can measure heat fluxes with them, we can measure radiation transfer and explain them how diffuse or and direct radiation works and how that is reflected by the snow surface.  
	Things like that are key competences and then we combine that with the competence on how to actually construct and design buildings, also from an energy point of view.  And that is more the architectural side of competence that we bring in there.  Where we have a focus however again on the energy physics so we’re doing a lot of... The students choose to do something with renewable energy, say solar or wind in the mountain environment, a little bit of hydro power.  We had also hydro power projects and so these are competences that we have actually developed also during the Week.  "
Luisa Pastore (E9),Competences,"So I think there are these four main competencies. So environmental aspects and architectural, energy, and then financial. So I think there are these four fields that has to go together. So probably the main competence that is taught is really try to learn how to work in an interdisciplinary environment, and being able to find the right compromise with the rest of the group to optimise the entire project. And being able to concentrate the energy and join forces to achieve a good quality project. And again I think, think out of the box. And learning to work in a broad perspective of sustainability, and getting familiar with new themes like energy; energy deficiency or economic feasibility.
SP1	Yes, so yes. On more concerning the social aspects, what do you think about the social competencies?
SP2	I think this is a bit lacking. I think it’s probably still a bit lacking in academia when talking about environmental design, unfortunately. Although we… There is potential inside [inaudible], I think, to get more collaboration with people who work in this direction, and I would be very interested in working, for example, on some interdisciplinary projects who also take into account social aspects. Yes, definitely."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Competences,"What are the main competences taught in this specific ENAC week?
SP2	So sustainability for sure, and then energy related to building and also to the environment. "
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Competences,"So I find it challenging for them, but also really… It’s… I think it’s the first time especially for a civil and environmental engineer that they need to, that they face a project, I think, together in a group. Of course, architects are much more into that, but for them it’s the first time that they have a short time and with, they’re working with a group, with other people, with other, yes, expert, let’s say.
Yes, and in a short time they really need to do many decisions, so it’s really nice also to see how they… They say, okay, this is our briefing and they do a briefing. In reality that would last one week, and they do it like in an hour and then after one hour they decide, okay, we go for this decision and then now we need to decide this, this, this, so it’s really active, I think.
And they know also that probably the final output won’t be their best because they don’t have time, but anyway the result they have is the result of a group, of a collaboration, so I find it really nice. From a [inaudible] point of view I think it’s a… It’s really helping the students."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Competences," So the temporary, there is a student that came to me.  We spent two days looking at the panel that we can put, and we realised that it does not work.  It’s worthless. We spent two days doing… No, finding that an idea is not a good idea is as important, if not more, than finding… That proving that your idea is good.  I mean, if you analyse an idea and it’s good, told at the beginning that it was good, well, we would have done it anyway.  But if you do it, do the analysis and you find out that it’s not useful, you avoid a big mistake and spending money on worthless stuff.  It’s something that he did not realise.  We talked a little bit by the evening and he said, Oh yes, I understand now, it’s not that useless at the end.  No. "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Competences,"So it’s appreciated from the students, and I saw some students after the first few Semaine ENAC and they told me, you know, most of the thing that we see in this week, we already saw it in other courses or we see it after in other courses.  But the finance and economic thing, we don’t see it anywhere.  So the only thing that is unique on the Semaine ENAC is the economic part."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Competences,"I took a part of the Finance 101 classes that I used to teach and, part on investment criteria, so that is the knowledge that they get.  That the important… Well, the investment criteria and the importance of parameters that underlie it, and the competencies is like more a general knowledge sensibility because they can… The few people that really work hard on the Excel file get more competencies out of my contribution.  But I think in general, just talking about and having those exchanges between this student that is in charge of the economic model and the impact on the other decision of the building is… So they have some… They develop a sensitivity.  It’s the competence that everybody gets.  
For those that really work on the economic model and really get involved, they get, like… They are able… They get what they would have got from a 45 hour Finance 101 class.  Well, few technicalities less than the Finance 101 class, but almost everything.  I mean, they work on a RAID project evaluation, taking into account different growth rate and I think that those that really get involved and do do it and try to understand each line, because I work a lot with them, I help them to build the model.  But I think those people get much more competency, and when they will provide information for the banker or the investor, they will be able to give the right information right at the beginning.  And even though if they don’t compute the value themselves they will provide it in the way that the banker just has to use it as it is.  With no problem, I mean.  That’s the competence that they get, yes."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Competences,"Bringing together the three competencies of the sections, coming up with a concept, conceptual work is important.  To define a project, to define objectives, something that is feasible in the week.  Design elements are important and as other teaching objectives I would say targeted analysis that could be data, that could be problems or connections.  All in the context of say an engineering background, engineering/design or artistic.  
Because for the architects I mean they also have to calculate but here we have to consider that the creative side of the students there.  And last but not least as I said they should also do experiments, practical work and so somebody... Let’s take the example of an architect who did all their... His projects using a design software.  They can also learn how to make measurements and maybe the environment students they can also get the chance to do something more a graphical design.  Because engineering also needs like sometimes a good packaging and so there are definitely synergies."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Competences,"Absolutely, I mean that’s... We are learning from them, they are learning from us and they are learning from each other."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Competences,"One kind of important thing is this kind of working together, simply put, and what it means to collaborate on a design problem when you’re from different disciplines.  So how you can develop a common language when you’re working together, and how you could negotiate between different interests, or different ideas, or different perspectives.  
So all of those things, you know, I think have to do with collaboration, and have to do with the kind of hands on making that is a big part of the week."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Competences,"Another thing that I think we were aiming for, trying to get them to work on is really to think about also drawing as a language, how the different disciplines use drawing to develop ideas.  And how they, you know, how they can communicate through drawing between each other, and between a built form and a drawing.  So that I think was something that was important. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Competences,"one other thing was, oh, this notion of really thinking about how you can use testing, or how you can use, or how you can kind of work with a reiterative design process, and testing process to develop an idea.  You know, what you can learn from a reiterative process.  
And in this case, a process where you actually kind of use a structural test to kind of break something, and identify weaknesses in the project.  So how you can use that iteration to make something better, or to develop something"
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Competences,"And through this working together maybe to understand a little bit better the disciplinary perspectives, or interests they bring to the work.  So making them more sensitive to that, I guess,"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Competences,"it’s nice that they have some hands-on experience, and maybe this is more important than the actual, you know, solving of the problems."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Competences,"maybe the studies are very theoretical, and then they actually see once, okay, this is how I test the water with a biological test system, or this is how I treat water with a UV system or something like that.  Then they actually see it once!  And maybe this is also a very important experience they have and they get more motivated in, for the rest of their studies."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Competences," to have a little bit more time with the students than in a lecture, that you can sit down and discuss in a round, you know, about all these issues that come up if you actually want to do something, you know.  It’s not like just solving an equation or so.  You have to think about many different aspects."
Tom Battin (E16),Competences,"irst of all, the idea was and is, right, that they kind of acquire some skills to work independently, like, [inaudible].  Also and they did get some guidance also, so what are the sources of information, right?  So what kind of information can they get, you know, so to work on a little project, "
Tom Battin (E16),Competences,"So that’s was definitely one expectation from our sides, right, that the students, they should learn to work independently, having a question in hand.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Competences,"I think it’s important they learn how to present themselves to the public.  How to present their results, but also not only being there, but also with some enthusiasm, Number 1, but also with more concept, with more structure, with etc., etc. on the one hand. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,"was really that idea that the devices [?] and the techniques made to domestic water, to turn it into an element of economy, production, organisation. Those techniques are valued [?] dimensions. So it’s anchored in the social technical approach. We think it’s still very important for engineers and architects to really grasp the idea that when they start drawing, when they start calculating, they, it doesn’t only have an impact on an object, it has an impact on a system. So it was relational [?] and systemic approach of their own discipline, and to be alert to fact that when they see a dam [?], or when they see a [unclear], it’s, yes, it brings out a whole economy. But it also brings out very specific question on water qualities, you know, about the way it glides. Yes. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,"All the way, or what happens when it’s stuck and back trails [?] develop and stuff like that. And the social [?] way, the idea was that to make them also sensitive to the fact that when, in relation with a certain system, they need also certain a type of knowledge. If you develop dams, then you will also put more money in certain types of research, and also you have another relation between the technique science and politic. And if you develop [unclear], and so yes, it was really…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,hat was actually the experience of a bus stop in the context of the city at night. 
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,"planning question and experience questions, and to see that it’s more, yes, that planning’s not just an obstruct [?] thing. It really has to be linked with what human beings are able to do, and how [inaudible], the resistance of reality and it’s not a [inaudible]. And the work of, yes, of producing them."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,"here were a bit less of the sensitive dimension, though they also when to that because they [unclear] were also with the artists, that it was to where [unclear] was more [unclear], but also the physical commitment of Walker."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,"here’s always testimonies of students saying that they kind of better understand the way their colleagues think, you know, and we have seen that. And you also see the confrontation and they are these groups where they have, they work [?] on these dams, and then it was very sequential and the project have done [?]."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Competences,"poorest way to have interdisciplinary question, and especially because in that group, maybe it was… But I don’t think it was on the whole group level, but there was a couple of them, especially one student from civil engineering who really stuck to his own knowledge, you know, and [unclear]. He was doing a presentation of something very rigid, ripe [?], it’s like producing the engineer image of the dam. "
Derek Christie (E3),Competences," I... I don't really know, would be my first, you know, most honest answer.  I think working on a project; having an open mind; and definitely, having a... I’d even say a trans-disciplinary outlook.  Working together, working as a team – definitely."
Derek Christie (E3),Competences,"specialises in the transport and mobility for handicapped people... people with a situational handicap.  Thanks to them, we were able, I think, to bring to the students, a completely new outlook.  The way you don't walk along a street the same way when you've done it walking with a blind person or a person in a wheelchair.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Competences," I think it’s an exercise of working together; of having an open mind; I think it opens people’s horizons.  Yes, they have to get to grips... grip with a lot of different fields, I guess, or at least skill competencies.  But I don't think we actually have a list of them – it’s quite open."
Derek Christie (E3),Competences,"you have to let the students work on their own, to a certain extent, so they develop their own way of doing things.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Competences,"key competency, actually.  It’s a very scientific competency, and it always makes you angry when someone says: this is a... oh, this is only an observational study.  Observation is, you know, the number one scientific method – you observe.  So, observation, I think, is... is really important."
Derek Christie (E3),Competences,"can let the students express this trans-disciplinary desire, which I think they have.  "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Competences,"SP2	Yes, I mean, what students learn is to first of all, clearly they get a notion of how the project works, so how… Like, I don’t know how it’s called in English. This first preliminary study you usually do if you have, for example, a consultancy job or for engineering. So they really learn how to systematically approach a question that they are given, how to… Yes, how to be very systematic in asking the right questions, in finding… In having a methodology, how to find questions in a given time. Then in addition, of course, they train how to give presentations, how to interact with each other. That’s… in this Week you can really… When you talk to students you can really feel that they’re very, they’re very happy about having the different disciplines because they have really rather different ways of working, so it’s… It’s always the same. The architects always say we work in a very different way from the others, but in reality I think it’s really three different types of students. Even if they haven’t… They’re not much advanced in their studies, of course, but they already… I wouldn’t say they have developed their way of working, but they have been given a vision of how their work should look like. So this… And then I think what is really something the students underestimate is this idea of having just a very short time to do something, and try to do what you can do in this time, which is a typical engineering thing, actually. Not that much a research aspect, but…"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Competences,"But the students really answered in a very creative way to that, like, some produced a video to show, to share their experience with other students. And yes, it’s something that is not… You could never transpose or transfer to another topic, "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Competences,"We came to the conclusion that there are many aspects that you need for project work that are never taught at EPFL and that are just supposed to naturally emerge from the students. It’s the same for the cours ENAC, yes. But there are competencies they’re just supposed to have."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"So mostly the teaching structure was introducing the students like an ex cathedra [?] to do a small workshop but more in a first of all ex cathedra to do a class to introduce them to the anthropology of dwelling in a way.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And plus a strong focus on the Indian context because the student need to understand what are a family, what are dwelling, what are.."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,So that was more on based on ex cathedra to do a class and we give them also text to read and to discuss.  And of course what we wanted to add also was some presentation of former student that did some field work in India.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"That was for instance last year Maria Letecia [?] that did a presentation on slum, was not in Ahmadabad but in Mumbai in slum close to Mumbai.  But just to give the students some more you know, some flesh on what we are telling.."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"So give them, to nourish them and providing them a lot of pictures so we as the Semaine weeks in... The ENAC week sorry is in Switzerland, Luzon and we work on India we cannot assume that the student know some element about India.
SP1	Sure, sure.
SP2	So our point was to try to provide them as much as we could some images, some link to Website and just to try to make them a little bit feel the atmosphere and the context.  But of course it’s a difficulty because they are not there"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"But they needed to work on the concrete construction, some of our students also did some models so they were always doing... "
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"The students can present some first findings.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And so they share with all of the group and then we reorganise them into groups so they can each expert can be part of a group."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"So for instance the very first year first edition we really maintain the five group of students because at the end we had five team.  It was not... The team was not the same from the beginning because we mix them in the middle of the week.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	But we still remain five group.  "
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,So they read the text and present it afterwards to the others so they have a common knowledge.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,Then they have a common knowledge and then they need to apply also this common knowledge to a specific empirical case studies.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"Where we reflected about what was done yesterday, the day before and what was to be done today."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"And apart from assisting the single groups what were other teaching methods that you applied to during the week?
SP3	So we followed especially the students who were doing also the... I mean the models."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"Were there some theoretical input lectures from teaching... From teachers?  Or were there just the...
SP3	That was the first day."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Didactical methods,"But I think that having also a model will help the student to better understand as the containers, "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Didactical methods,"formational apprenticeship of what, for the different themes, we had in the ENAC Week and about three days were kept to work together.  "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Didactical methods,"Well the support was that we, the organisation, so we told them what they had to do, because it was  not very obvious always, and then we take part in the discussions, we let them discuss by themselves and we then we listen to what they’re proposing there and then we try to find out what’s okay and what’s not okay and so we give them more input so they can continue.  Sometimes ideas, sometimes methods are too grand for instance and our role is also to make conclusions then, or help them to make conclusions and to put it all together.   As we had been almost 30 people, so at one point you have to say now what do we decide and put it all together."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Didactical methods,"a few lectures but very few as we want to spend a lot of time on the site.  And then we had short presentations and after the first phase they had to present their work [inaudible], so at the end we had another two hours after the Week, so they had to present what they did do in the Week and we gave them feedback on this."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Didactical methods,"create as an presentation, as a document, and the second Tuesday, after the Week, it was the presentation itself."
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods,"We also had an early architect that was quite important, that was Wim van der Hoede, who was in the first two ENACs there on the architecture side.  He was also helping a lot with trying to see, you know, that they can actually build their little models and all the idea about wind tunnel testing and so that these were locally developed at SLF."
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods," we then thought it would be good to involve the local energy company so we, since I already knew the CEO there so I asked him if he would come and give a lecture."
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods,"In addition I had my own house constructed in a way that it serves as an object for analysis for the students which is also quite successful because it provides them data, data on photo or text production in this very environment compared to solar thermal production consumption data and where the data all from the same place and particularly prepared for the students so that they can have easy access to that.  So these are the key elements and they have an example that they can sort of test then their own ideas against.  "
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods,So we have an introductory day or introductory phase one where we have an excursion
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods,"they also get a talk by the CEO of the local energy company.  In addition to that then there’s lecturing, giving them the more basics"
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods,And then in phase two is basically the students will develop then their own concepts with critique from us teachers
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods," In addition every project must have an experimental part, so they need to measure something, put their hands on something, either on a model and measure in a cold lab how the temperature decreases with a certain amount of heating or measure some radiation input as in a snowy environment, in a non-snowy environment, look at the differences and do things like that."
Michael Lehning (E11),Didactical methods,"Okay, and so in a nutshell which are the main teaching methods you use?
SP2	I think it’s supervising, it’s, I don’t know how you would call that in technical terms, but the main teaching methods, there is a certain amount of lecturing but we keep it, we keep this part very, very, you know, not, it shouldn’t cover most of the time and most of the teaching is basically supervised work by the students where we show them with hands-on experience how to do their things.  If they want to measure something then we have to show them how to set up the instruments, how to read out the data on the logger, how to... 
	We give them also preconfigured Excel sheets because otherwise in a week it will be difficult for them to programme enough to get stuff out.  So they get first solid hands-on experience by supervised work that they do themselves, I mean we really focus on that they should do the work themselves.  And also do some background search on the internet, see what data they find and if we have the impression that they didn’t find the right data then we point them to the right sources or even give them the data like on energy production and things."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Didactical methods,"So I actually also contributed, since I got involved the last year, proposing this new themes for this Semaine ENAC, of the design of the micro and temporary architecture. That was quite successful because the students found it very, yes, creative, something that you can once in a while go out of the box and invent something and try to, yes, like sort of exaggerate, but in good terms during this week. So also having some fun."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Didactical methods,"So there are four different teachers with four different lectures that teach different topics from environmental to economics and architecture, energy. Different aspects. And then we have the complementary supervision of these four teachers while guiding the students in developing their project."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Didactical methods,"so the way I proceed was to give a base of theoretical content at the beginning usually, so this is done normally one week before the real intense week in Davos. And in parallel there is also, I think this is very important, to give, to show case studies. So I think it’s important for the students to have reference of something that has been done in a sense, and that they can draw inspiration from"
Luisa Pastore (E9),Didactical methods,"And then there is a first phase that is based on observation and discussion, but I would say limited discussion during the first brainstorming of the students among, in their groups"
Luisa Pastore (E9),Didactical methods,Then there is a third phase of detailed supervision. So then you really can give some technical suggestions and guidance.
Luisa Pastore (E9),Didactical methods,"And then there is also the experimental part, so they try to complement what they’re theoretically developing with some practical application. And as teachers we also try to accept their experiments and to guide them and to suggest some methodologies to optimise them"
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Didactical methods,"Of course also during the day we go person by person in different groups, but then it’s more important where we are all together because we kind of finalise, or we direct all together the project in one direction, instead of just suggesting different things."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Didactical methods,"So we give them a really general explanation of the problem, and then we let them explore the solutions. So it’s… I feel that it’s really important that they feel kind of free in what they do. Of course they are led by us and we try to push them in one direction, but without being too much, I don’t know, yes, to push them too much, of course. "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Didactical methods,"at the end of the day we see each team and we try to help them, like a critique for architects to help them to focus on a part of the project or to help them, like, get to the point.  So I really like this interactive teaching where… Well, for me, I get involved more in the two last days in the projects because they have to collect some data to build a model, and they have to have a better… A good idea of where they are going.  So, I really like to help the students when they arrive with the real questions, okay, what do we do?  Why do we do that?  And okay, provide me with that information and I will show you how to use it."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Didactical methods,"Like, the questions were really, like, task-oriented, so the… All this one-to-one, the iteration between student, professor.  We let them work, we go to them to go, okay, how does it work?  Just showing that we are there.  How does it go?  Do you have everything right?  And they are, oh, we have that, we have that.  And they know, like, they know Giorgia is, like, a specialist for the solar thing, so when it’s Giorgia that comes around and says, okay, they ask questions about solar.  If it’s me, it’s about economic stuff like that.  When it’s Hendrik, it’s how are our experiments? Stuff.  So it’s really… They know how to use us and it’s really a… Well, I mean, it’s… I don’t know how would classify the didactic approach but it’s really trial and error and learning by doing."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Didactical methods,"So here we have basically once they define their projects we help them of course with defining their project, I should also mention that we do an excursion.
SP1	Right.
SP2	So that is the students get familiar with the environment where they are and that they really see in which context they are working, I think that’s also important, that’s a half day excursion but it gives them a good impression.  And then in terms of teaching we are a big team I think, like this year we were six, seven for 25 students that’s quite an impressive ratio.  And we accompany them in their process of doing a project and we interact a lot with them in group discussions like all the experts from the teaching side talking to the individual groups.  We have usually groups of five students and so after the lectures it becomes really, really interactive and another I think interesting tool that we are using is what we call the desk critique.  That all teachers come typically twice during the week and visit the small groups and we discuss with them their project, this is like a collective, interactive discussion."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Didactical methods,"And there in this case we have basically seven teachers for five students and they explain us what they have in mind, we give them input and feedback and normally it’s half an hour and then we go to the next group.  And this is very I think productive and also helps a lot to put them on track that after that they are kind of independent.  I mean we do want that they work independently also and we give them the necessary guidance.  So this is a bit our teach concept"
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Didactical methods,"The actual week is always busy with experiments and so on we applied for the first time the oral presentations after the Semaine ENAC.  And I think this was a nice experience for them to summarise the things, to present it also to the other groups who during the Semaine work on their project.  And probably don’t realise so much what the others are doing and plus it was I think a fairly good preparation for the plenum next week."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Didactical methods,we felt like giving them the time to work because we did find last year that they were super engaged.
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Didactical methods,"we never had any problems kind of, you know, having the students there and working.  They really appreciated that.  So I think we this year, gave them even more time in some sense."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Didactical methods,"the week was structured in terms of these testing sessions.  And you know, as you know it’s very few days.  And I think it’s also structured on the material limitations that they have to work with, in the sense that they first day they’re, you know, working with wood that they find in the forest.  
You know, the second one they’re working with wood members that they’re just being introduced to, so something which is a totally new material.  And the third time they do the project, they’re working with material that’s a little bit more familiar to them, in that they’ve already done it once.  So you know, in that sense, these three sessions structure the hands on element.  
And I would say that the lectures, the two lectures that we did are, you know, come at the early part of the week to maybe put them in a mind-set that makes them a little critical of reflective of how they’re working.  So that they can not only do things and work together, but also maybe be in mind-set to kind of think about how they’re doing things, and think about how they’re working together."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Didactical methods,"we asked them really to put together a dossier where they talked about the process, where they reflected on the process and articulated the process.  So rather than documenting the finished product, you know, by getting them to talk about the process, I think we implicitly, we asked them to talk about the collaboration and other aspects"
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Didactical methods,"the lectures, the testing sessions.  And also the kind of, you know, one on one sessions, where we would speak to them when they were working in groups, those were the three main kind of teaching moments of interaction, I would say, yes."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Didactical methods," I’d just prepared - and I also had some colleagues to help me – we prepared some talks; we...  I gave them links to MOOC [?], that there are some courses on water treatment.  And then we would have discussions in a smaller group to, you know, to sort of discuss with them what they think. how this problem should be solved, and what, where the problems should be, would be, and, you know, what kind of water resources would be available and maybe do some simple calculations about, you know, the rainfall – if this would be sufficient to provide drinking water, etc.  So it was more or less a discussion, and we tried to engage the students as much as possible, that they would start thinking themselves what would be needed."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Didactical methods," And then the specialists, they were distributed into different groups, and there they would help the architects and the civil engineers to solve the water problems."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Didactical methods,"we already prepared some water treatment systems, because this would not have been possible that they start from scratch.  So, of course, there was already some material that was prepared and then it was not completely open in what direction it would go."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Didactical methods," to have a little bit more time with the students than in a lecture, that you can sit down and discuss in a round, you know, about all these issues that come up if you actually want to do something, you know.  It’s not like just solving an equation or so.  You have to think about many different aspects."
Tom Battin (E16),Didactical methods,"But that means that we are, you know, at their full disposal, you know?  Whenever they need something they should come and ask this fucking question, right, and to interact with us. "
Derek Christie (E3),Didactical methods,"I think most of them were not involved at all in the organisation of the week.  There’s a historic reason – I don't know if we’re going to talk about it later – why there are people from the outside.  I think there’s an historic element to that.  There was one person from the outside, called, Bettina Shadfly [?], who is, more or less, part of the core team, although, this year she was not very available.  It didn’t look, actually, that she was part of the core team, but she was.  I missed the first day because I was in a conference abroad.  But, otherwise, the people who intervened...  who came to say...  to give talks on something, were basically from the outside.  They were not involved in the organisation."
Derek Christie (E3),Didactical methods,"So those already, are two methods.  One method is to say: do this.  The other is to say: just go out there, walk around and see what happens.  And observe. "
Derek Christie (E3),Didactical methods,"key competency, actually.  It’s a very scientific competency, and it always makes you angry when someone says: this is a... oh, this is only an observational study.  Observation is, you know, the number one scientific method – you observe.  So, observation, I think, is... is really important."
Derek Christie (E3),Didactical methods,"bviously you've got to think; you've got to think about it.  And then they were asked to produce maps; they were asked to use photography; they were asked, to a certain extent, to use quantitative methods, due to the fact of only having a few hours or a few days.  It didn’t really matter how many people they had, but it had to be a quantitative approach.  Like, having a small questionnaire; asking, maybe, 15, 20 people to answer the questionnaire.  So, it’s mixed methods on a... on a, you know, really small scale.  Almost every group had a quantitative, a qualitative and a special aspect, that’s what they did."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Didactical methods,"What really structured around a question and a geographical area. So all students had different topics about the question of pedestrian mobility in this particular area, in the west of the campus. So part… Half of the groups, they had an additional focus on disabled people. And so this Week was clearly, strongly articulated around the specific topic, which was very much… Yes, it was really… It was quite well-defined, the questions, but not the method how to address it, let’s say."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Didactical methods,"mixture between just giving the topics, telling them what the general message is to address it, and lectures, because they had this new focus on disabled people."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Didactical methods,"So there were people from outside who came to talk about this, from a legal aspect, from also practical issues. Then in addition, there was also something we hadn’t done before, they had this… What in French you call mise en situation, so they had the experience to actually see what it means to move, like, if you’re blind."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Didactical methods,"idea came largely from the people, the sort of external… What was it, a consultancy company, I think"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week," And again I think that is also one of the issues of the Semaine ENAC when you work a multidisciplinary team.
SP1	Okay, the different expectations maybe...
SP3	Yes.
SP1	How quick something works out or not.
SP2	Yes, it’s... To give you an example for instance with our competencies on cultural and social dimension the student need time to integrate all the lectures, all the... Need time to understand.  Of course you can listen to a presentation but then you need to digest the information into restitute.
SP1	Yes, sure.
SP2	And that, according to each of us it takes more less time.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And it’s true that for instance working with the steel construction for instance the student needed to make some calculations because it’s... They have model, they have mathematics models, they need to make the calculation.
SP1	Sure.
SP2	And it’s... Of course it takes time but at least they do have [foreign language]...
SP3	A result or something they can show.
SP2	Yes, but how, I’m just looking... Yes, when you do a calculation... You do have... What is the name?
SP3	An equation.
SP2	An equation for instance.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And it’s based on an equation they can... Okay they have some factors maybe.
SP1	Hard facts.
SP2	Yes, exactly and they kind of say okay, that is how we can calculate the... I don’t know the way we can put on the container or not...
SP1	Yes, sure.
SP2	And it’s much more quicker which is not the case for us for instance.
SP1	Yes, it’s much more concrete.
SP2	But that’s also what makes the ENAC week interesting."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"This year it was I think quite a challenge especially for...
SP2	Yes.
SP3	Colleagues supervising the construction work to do it in four days.
SP2	Yes.
SP3	They did very well."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week, Of course it’s time consuming to prepare
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,o it was a little bit difficult to make all our goals together.  The difficulty from the teaching staff was they perhaps had not all the same objectives or the same goals.
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,We did not really work together; it was difficult to work together with anybody.
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"Okay so do you refer there to the different disciplinary backgrounds or was it more personal?
SP2	No it was personal.  
SP1	Okay.
SP2	But sometimes it’s also from the background of the people, because they, they came all from [inaudible] construction parts, so they have it from a theoretical point, but if you go to a real construction they don’t know how to do it."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"And I think also they express that in the evaluation they gave, so they are always really happy about the Semaine ENAC, Davos. I don’t know about the others, but probably… They are always complaining about the amount of work they have, but I think, I mean, I don’t know. They also have fun kind of designing the project together, it could be also fun."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"Okay. So, again, the problem, it’s that they had not enough time to develop the project, that was a problem that they also told us, but they realised that it wasn’t really our fault."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"SP1	Okay.  So the organisation between the teaching staff was not optimal, because [INAUDIBLE].
SP2	Yes, it was not optimal, because, you know, it was always difficult to find a date"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"the initiator, he just disappeared from the field, yes, and I think next year we will have like a fire-fighting exercise again!"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"I think this is, of course, not up to me, yes, to…  I mean, I suggest it, but then if this person who is in charge of the programme doesn’t want to take it up, then it’s his decision, yes"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"we sort of had architects, civil engineers and environmental engineers, so they were in their second year.  And so, you know, we think, okay, they should work together to build this project, but actually they don’t have so much background in their field."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week," basically they never heard anything about water treatment; they probably didn’t have a lot of information on, you know, statics [?] for construction of buildings and things like that."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"So you have to teach them very quickly; in a few hours you have to teach them basics of, in my case, of water treatment and waste water management.  And so they’re, you know, they’re like, almost like beginners, you know.  And then you say, okay, now you’re the expert on water; you have to solve this problem.  So I think, from that point of view, in my opinion, it’s almost a little bit too early in the curriculum."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"they have minimal knowledge on the topics they should work on.  Maybe it’s different in others, Semaine ENACs. But in my case, you know, in my specific field, I know I teach these students in the Master course these, the competence that they would need for the Semaine ENAC.  So I think then you basically just have to teach them in a few hours what they need to know, and after that you basically leave them to…  But you have to help them, of course, quite a lot to work on this projec"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"you do this in three consecutive years, but then there are always other students.  So then, in one year, you know, you bring the students; in one week they achieve a certain knowledge; the next year you have new students, so they have to start from zero again.  But then they have to speed up because they have to get further the next week.  So then you cannot go into the detail so much any more, because then they have to really start constructing something."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"they started to build some walls, and...  But, you know, they’re beginners and then already after the Semaine ENAC, over the weekend these walls, some of the walls collapsed, yes.  So I think, you know, in terms of the actual construction, they would also need more instructions.  I mean, the…  So they probably would need some person from a real construction company come here…"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"If you work with 20 students, then there’s always a tendency that the entropy gets very large and it just diffuse away if it’s not so clear what they have to do.’"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"In our ENAC Week we also had a little bit discrepancies between two teachers, and so they had different ideas how to do it, and I think this also created a little bit…  I mean, it was not visible to the students…"

Derek Christie (E3),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"Obviously, one group was, perhaps, not quite as good as the others, but that’s completely to be expected.  And even... even the weaker groups were really quite good."
Derek Christie (E3),Difficulties encountered\Difficulties within the ENAC Week,"To show this is what can be done, and it’s a very good idea, except that it interrupted the work that they were doing.  So, we basically only had a day and a half to produce their work.  And some of them, I suspect, principally the architects really wanted to produce something that looks good: maybe that’s a kind of professional deviation, whatever it is.  But, I think a lot of them worked very hard and they felt that the time... the way time is organised in a single week is really a big challenge.  And I remember that Dominque was coming to see us two months before, even three months before, already, you know: what are we going to do on the Monday afternoon.  And what... in the second part of Tuesday morning?  Could we possibly put this in here?  And someone is coming from the outside; she can't come on Thursday, so how are we going to manage it. "

SP1	Takes time, yes.

Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"o they started the research together for different reasons, so they, they had some personal problems between some people in the group.  I don’t know how this will be managed [?], perhaps it will be different.  We did not really work together; it was difficult to work together with anybody."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,And you have to have a theme that everybody works more or less on the level.  And this is not always easy. 
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"I was saying that I felt that, perhaps not for me, but for the other people it was difficult to reserve one, the whole Week more or less for this course.  So at several moments we have meetings and one or two of the teachers they couldn’t be here, because they had other obligations.  So this is probably a problem."
Michael Lehning (E11),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"And because everybody is already quite committed and so if you come and you know that can only cover a certain aspect of such an interdisciplinary teaching venture then you need to get the team together.  
	So I remember I showed up at Marilyn Anderson’s office and I, and she was quite busy in preparing an ERC proposal at the time so she was not very happy to see me come with another task"
Michael Lehning (E11),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"And then we already knew that we needed to make the time which came at a bad time because I had at the same to prepare a new lecture on atmospheric physics, a full Bachelor class which I’ve never taught before.

Hendrik Huwald (E7),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"there is probably at this point still a lack of recognition.  Because as I mentioned earlier not only being present for a week for the teaching but all the preparation, all the post-processing, the reports, you know, evaluation and so on takes a lot of time.  And this somehow has to be at least recognised that whatever you invest in as time is not available for other things.  And it’s a choice, if you know, ENAC wants us to be a seriously involved in Projeter Ensemble you cannot write a paper the same time. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties," If we are talking about the section they are basically managing the teaching, they are usually happy.  If people are involved you know it’s part of our job, it’s... So the section is very favourable to this and there is also no... Not really, well there may be competition in a sense that you say I have already four lectures and I don’t have time to do a Semaine ENAC.  Or the other way around, you really do a Semaine ENAC fully involved and then you say okay, then I cannot do my fourth lecture anymore or an additional one.  This is also something that section has to realise that there are limits."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"we’re all pressed for time.  In some sense we don’t know how to find people in those departments who could be interested in the same thing.

Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"We weren’t professors or anything like that.  So we don’t have, in a way, the resources to invest in making those links."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,the value of the ENAC Week might not be high enough so people are not so motivated to participate
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties," you have to do some teaching and you have to do research and, of course, the research is, has the highest value of your activities, yes.  And then you have to do course teaching, and then the ENAC Week is, in principle, something you do in addition to this.  So...   And so maybe, you know, the incentive to do it might not be high enough"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"it’s also like the environmental engineering – they don’t have so many topics that are, yes, valuable for the other groups in ENAC. "
Urs von Gunten (E17),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"sometimes when I tell people, yes, I’m participating in ENACH Week, they say, oh, no, I would not do this, yes.
SP1	Good, that’s interesting, actually.  And why?
SP2	I think just because of time constraints, yes.  I mean, it’s quite intense, yes; you have to be there the whole week.  And I think you...  I mean, you don’t have to be present like the whole day, but, you know, from time to time you have to discuss with students, so I usually reserve a whole week for that and that’s a lot of time "
Tom Battin (E16),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,e ego of some of my colleagues may also kind of suffer from this.
Tom Battin (E16),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,I’m not aware of anybody who this year participated to Semaine ENAC.  
Tom Battin (E16),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"ut because, you know, I talked to some of them.  Those I’ve been talking to they were not part of any Semaine ENAC.  I do know, of course that many of the topics, the ideas of former, of past Semaine ENAC, of course, came from professors.  But then, they never showed up. "
Tom Battin (E16),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"It’s also a question of how far do I identify myself with this kind of interdisciplinary work because interdisciplinary work very often, it’s becoming something watery.  And you know, so what is the benefit I have from that?"
Tom Battin (E16),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"erall I found that for the overall level of this Semaine, and Semaine [inaudible] ENAC that, you know, where I got some feedback from, is relatively low.  It’s relatively low.  And I wonder whether that’s good, also like, for the future of the Semaine ENAC because obviously, EPFL wants to hit high.  So we should hit high with the Semaine ENACs, as well. "

And this week for example, you have people who are less present for… Well, we had, part of the teaching team was here all the time, and Tom Battin for example done [?] it because…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"And then there’s no answer to that. So to that, because we don’t have any tool to make it worth, in a certain way it should go, if you’re teaching in [unclear] for example. They, it’s really strict and calculated, the time you spend, so if you spend one week of teaching, then you probably gain it on other level, you know, that you won’t have, maybe people will have a class less in fall. And then it’s very interesting because it’s really something you can play with, in [unclear], you do it but it’s just extra charge, actually. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"it’s important for labs to really have it as a tool for investigation and stuff like that, and…"
Derek Christie (E3),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"And, our students told us that they thought it was great working on this, but they had exams and things that they had to give in: projects and so on.  In parallel, these things were not slowing down, because of the ENAC week.  So maybe thought has to be given to the integration of the ENAC week, into the rest of the school year.  The exams, I think, are not for a few weeks.  I don't know when they are.   But... apparently the timing was not that good for some of the students.  They even had to go away and they had to miss two hours."
Derek Christie (E3),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"They had some strange meeting to do with: if you are a student and you want to find student lodgings, you had to go to this meeting.  So that was a bit unfortunate.  The timing is very tight, that’s the perhaps the main problem – one week is very short. "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"Professors, yes. I think the most important thing is to just ask the students to be able to switch off during the Week, from your everyday work. To say okay, I’m really leaving my research aside and getting completely involved in the Week, which to some researchers, professors, is extremely hard"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"They are supposed to really just work for this and not think of their project, but that’s really… I guess that’s, for many outsiders, that’s hard to say, like, to see how you do that. In other environments like at universities, normally you have field weeks. So you go physically away, you have to."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Difficulties encountered\Institutional difficulties,"it was present for him, but then the rest of the colleagues still didn’t know what it actually is, so… But it’s like most teaching stuff, actually. It’s happening in parallel… To do research and… Yes. It’s certainly not something that is particularly present, but it’s just like all classes."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Future\Future development of the week,"And afterwards is there a plan to continue it somehow or is it just finished?
SP2	So that will depend on the what they wants to do with the seed construction.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	We plan to have a different activities related to each institution such as Alan Izbaumer he’s the construction, [Inaudible name] with Lebanon case studies and us with the Indian case studies.
SP1	Yes, okay."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Future\Future development of the week,"So yes, year two... So now 2017 that was the first step of the concrete transformation of containers."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Future\Future development of the week,"And I think next year there will be a change in the PhD students, so there will be another PhD student here who wants to join.

Philippe Belanger (E13),Future\Future development of the week,"I don’t know who at the base, at the beginning decided to have Josep, me and Hendrik, and Parag in the team, but it ends up that we were meant to work together in this Semaine ENAC.  And I really hope that I can continue to contribute to the Semaine ENAC. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Future\Future development of the week," Fred’s leaving next year.  He’s not going to be here.  So if my two colleagues from ALIS, who are going to stay, if they take it up, they’ll probably ask me to come again.  So you know, we’ve all been in contact, trying to figure out whether they can do it, or who’s going to do it.  
I think we would probably try to change things a little bit next year, to tweak them a little bit because my two colleagues are working also on a cement ENAC, where they’re working with concrete, concrete research.  So we might try to find a way to make this week also looking at that.  
SP1	Okay, so maybe also integrating someone as a teacher from the material science or engineering [inaudible]? 
SP2	Maybe, you know, because they’re in the cement, what is it called?  [Non-English] that they’re doing, they’ve really been successful at kind of involving people from the different departments, from the concrete labs.  And so I think, you know, since those contacts have been made in a more kind of, in a stronger kind of way, I think it’s possible that we would try to involve them, yes."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Future\Future development of the week,"And, you know, this ENAC week on one topic goes for three years.  So in the first year the idea was to gather some background material to have some first ideas how to do it.  In the second year – this was this year – the students actually started to construct these containers, and next year this will be finalised"
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Future development of the week,"So my idea here is at least having, like, two steps before having the semaine, and not themselves.  So it would even be, like, in the [inaudible], like, so that they get the kind of lecture on the necessity, the beauty, etc., etc. of interdisciplinary work.  So that they get… And they are really, really prepared and aware of that this is an interdisciplinary field, right? "
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Future development of the week," They need to get, like, trained in soft skills.  Like, for instance, presenting, you know, what they did, for instance, on the one hand.  So really, like, presentation skills, but also skills in writing, etc., etc. "
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Future development of the week,"And that’s like, the basic structure that I would definitely maintain.  There may be ways to optimise this.  For instance, again, you know, feed them with information.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Future development of the week,"So it’s a warming up phase, or ramping up phase.  So that’s really something that I would like to see implemented.  That would then facilitate the actual work during the Semaine ENAC enormously. "
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Future development of the week,"It’s like, the very close and continuous contact between the students and the teachers.  So that’s also great.  "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Future development of the week,"when there are few of them, it’s always sort of more difficult to [inaudible] them completely express their… We want to do, next week, next year normally it’s, Tom Battin will take over and so we want to try to see what’s happening when it’s not…Because it’s quite special, because if I leading [?] it, I’m a sociology [unclear], so it’s even more complex, ENAC week, because it’s really [inaudible] from what they know."

And fountains are very important architectural elements of villages, and social elements."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Future development of the week,"And next week, next year I think we will try to go one step further in the interdisciplinary with the, hopefully [?] the analysis of the eco-bacteria in the water and on [unclear] analysis of the fountain and its infrastructure. I don’t know if…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Future development of the week,"we are going to, well, to change the little sheet. So switch to environmental science, and with the idea hopefully to have something also, some assignments which are directly linked. Because the problem we have with this week, or we had also in Brussels, it’s a certain way assignments where I [unclear]. They were strong, in Brussels especially, a social description assignment and the people actually go and observe, and make interviews, and a couple of them have done that also in Valais."

Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Future development of the week,"And we took an object which is more [unclear], the idea is to take that object which is a bit more focused, which is because it’s fountains in villages. And so it will also…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Future development of the week,"we had also more focused object in Valais, with dams and [unclear]. We will have only one. So we are going to… And we said we had many of them, which team was working on a completely different, but with the same type of methodology. And we also, it would be more working, more focused and we’ll see [unclear]. It allow [?] us to go faster on such an aspect [?] and liberate time for the students to work on the subject, and lesser down the impression of being overwhelmed with information, and it was very short time."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Future\Future development of the week,"But now that I also have a much better knowledge in this field, I also can really contribute new topics on the relation between this question and on environmental aspects."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Future\Future development of the week,"profit if the student had more theoretical background, but that’s so specific to the different topics that it’"
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Planned outputs ,he idea is to produce something also of this Semaine ENAC.  And the one from the last year is on the way.  A
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Planned outputs ,"first Luca Pattaroni and Barbara Tirone who proofread this,"
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Planned outputs ,"he students themselves, they have something in hand.  I was part of that.  It’s great.  And I mean, this is like, a high level that requires lots and lots of effort also from the teachers.  But I don’t think that they would have to go that far.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Future\Planned outputs ,"that should also have some reflections on the home page of the whatever, ENAC, or wherever, you know, where this product being made available on the home page, even. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Planned outputs ,"Yes, but that’s constant [unclear]. I’m quite glad that they make well, good job, they did a good job, the students, and we will try to publish something in fall. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Planned outputs ,"Like a brochure, like we have done for the other years. You have seen the brochure, have you?"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Planned outputs ,"And we have the [unclear] portion with now done, but we don’t have that much money left and so it’s on PDF form. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Future\Planned outputs ,"Yes, exactly. It’s right here. I don’t know where I put it, but I know I do have it on my desk. When I have people help it [?], everything [unclear]. It’s somewhere around here. "
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Future\Planned outputs \Planned outputs ,In our field work and what we are now developing also in terms of publication based of this I would say intermediate or intermediary findings.  
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Future\Planned outputs \Planned outputs ,Which would be put in implementers of this solution both as post disaster and in other context.   So I think this is really back and forth between this project there with concrete possible implementations and what the students here are doing.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Future\Planned outputs \Planned outputs ,"Yes, electronically but this year I don’t know if you mention it, this year we decided not to do a booklet but to do posters.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	Yes.
SP2	And the poster will be shown during the entire year in the construction site as well."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Future\Planned outputs \Planned outputs ," So that’s why I’m still involved, and there are a few research projects that we are still talking about that may come out of the Semaine ENAC"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,"So the student can really also think about how in a situation and past catastrophe situation how do you concretely one month, one year, ten years after you used the container to re-urbanise an area of the city?"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,So that was ten years after and the idea was really to think about how you can re-urbanise an area neighbourhood of a former city that has been destroyed by earthquake in our case.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,"So they bring us a lot of ideas and this year we had the second bench of student working with... Second other bench of student working on the second edition actually of the sum in ENAC.  And we decided to work more precisely on the transformation itself of the containers, that’s why we had some two containers on the campus."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,And the idea of next year will be to work on the completion in a way of the containers but also to work more on the inside container with the very close... The very close neighbours of the containers.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,so that’s why also other contribution were quite important to make them understand that you have different communities. 
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,"So that’s how also the work that has been done in the ENAC week also in terms of proposing some possible layouts or transformations in a container could be useful for our you know, context there."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,"I would say our objective with that... The students get sensitised of how to work on a technical dimension locating the problem and the projects as I said before in its broader social cultural context.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	So it’s related to the first one but it’s a bit... This thing I mean in that sense we highlight the fact that technical competencies and the skills need to be adapted.
SP1	Yes.
SP3	And to be thought of in their broader context...
SP1	Sure, in a more systemic context."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,"So the idea was as Christine mentioned as we are not working on Switzerland or in Europe the idea is really to also let the student understand that there is another reality and that you need to reflect on your own common sense, your own integrity.  What you used to do to have, how do you used to work, how do you... How do you imagine living in a container or living in a house here and what are the need, what are the habits, what are the customs, what are the family size, what are the... In another country."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week, but the object were their result of the week was really to transform these containers.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Goal of the week,But I mean the aim of the ENAC week was not only to do the onsite transformation but to reflect on three periods of time of just after the disaster then after one year how would that look like?
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Goal of the week,"Well the main driver is, so the organisation was [inaudible], but I had the role as the main driver more during the Week to kind of, to group all together and to look that they work together.  There were other teachers, there were about six teachers in all"
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Goal of the week,"And then the second thing was to have to work together, and they learnt how the architects worked, how civil engineering are thinking and working and some of the other side they had to help them, because architects they can, they do drawings so they draw for civil engineers, and civil engineers help architects to design structures.  So from this point of view it was really an exchange.  That’s what I think one of the main goals [?] in the ENAC Week."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Goal of the week," So that project evolved with the reality that surrounds Davos and the different data that we have.  So that’s interesting and as professor team we get better.  We’re, like, knowing what are the issues that the student will have.  We are able to push a little bit further, like, this three angle roof with the battery, with a lot of iteration to find… The idea was not to really find the right orientation, the right sizing, but to make the student understand that the optimisation of such buildings, green buildings is not that obvious.  It depends on a lot of data on some variability of the data you have.  "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Goal of the week,"The engineers and the architect need to feed the right information.  And to understand the iteration that needs to go from the architecture and the investor in order to make the best project to free more resources for such projects.  So that’s the mission that I give myself in that week.  I think I have quite an impact so maybe I’m cocky a little bit, but…"
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Goal of the week,"So it has its own dynamic I would say and in the meantime we also have as you noticed from the other discussions we have our reputation.  It’s a reputation is that it’s a work intensive week and this is wanted.  I mean up to the point that they start to mention to workload that is at the limit but we almost want it this way.  Because our goal is that they learn something, it should not be a wasted week where they do nothing."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Goal of the week,"what are the main competencies which are taught in your specific ENAC week?
SP2	I think we want... I mean there is the common thing that we want to bring together the three sections.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	Do a project work together, give... Expose them to a work experience that is probably unique so far to their curriculum, maybe they have done already some [inaudible] or I’m sure I know that they have done.  But it’s the first time that they work with their colleagues from other sections.  And I think this is also very much in line of the new EPFL philosophy of the discovery learning labs, I make reference to the inauguration of the E building yesterday.  Which brings you know, like the goal there is to expose the students already at a bachelor level to simple research.  To complement the theoretical knowledge with practice, with hands-on experiments and this is exactly what we also want to do in the Semaine ENAC."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Goal of the week,"the main motivation was really bringing architects together with engineers.  I thought it could be really interesting to have them be working on a practical kind of problem, a problem of making together because I think, you know, they do have different approaches to designing, or different approaches to understanding structural or built systems. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Goal of the week," although architects might be a little bit more comfortable with making, I thought it could be interesting to bring the two disciplines together in this somewhat neutral field, and have them kind of work through the questions and the problems that they usually work through in a more kind of theoretical or design context, into a different context, where they’re actually kind of building."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Goal of the week,"One kind of important thing is this kind of working together, simply put, and what it means to collaborate on a design problem when you’re from different disciplines.  So how you can develop a common language when you’re working together, and how you could negotiate between different interests, or different ideas, or different perspectives.  
So all of those things, you know, I think have to do with collaboration, and have to do with the kind of hands on making that is a big part of the week."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Goal of the week,"Another thing that I think we were aiming for, trying to get them to work on is really to think about also drawing as a language, how the different disciplines use drawing to develop ideas.  And how they, you know, how they can communicate through drawing between each other, and between a built form and a drawing.  So that I think was something that was important. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Goal of the week,"one other thing was, oh, this notion of really thinking about how you can use testing, or how you can use, or how you can kind of work with a reiterative design process, and testing process to develop an idea.  You know, what you can learn from a reiterative process.  
And in this case, a process where you actually kind of use a structural test to kind of break something, and identify weaknesses in the project.  So how you can use that iteration to make something better, or to develop something"
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Goal of the week,"And through this working together maybe to understand a little bit better the disciplinary perspectives, or interests they bring to the work.  So making them more sensitive to that, I guess,"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Goal of the week," they wanted to develop some containers for emergency situations, so the idea is to have ship containers, because ship containers are...  You can find them everywhere on the planet.  And in case of an earthquake or another emergency you could use the ship containers as housing, and then actually develop whole cities or smaller communities out of the ship containers."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Goal of the week,"it’s nice that they have some hands-on experience, and maybe this is more important than the actual, you know, solving of the problems."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Goal of the week,"maybe the studies are very theoretical, and then they actually see once, okay, this is how I test the water with a biological test system, or this is how I treat water with a UV system or something like that.  Then they actually see it once!  And maybe this is also a very important experience they have and they get more motivated in, for the rest of their studies."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Goal of the week,"the value of the Semaine ENAC is that they see, okay, other disciplines, they work like that; they do things that are different in the, for example, in the environmental engineering.  And, also, the sort of the...  To get an idea of the complexity, if you want to do something like that, yes, then I think that’s also quite instructive"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Goal of the week," to have a little bit more time with the students than in a lecture, that you can sit down and discuss in a round, you know, about all these issues that come up if you actually want to do something, you know.  It’s not like just solving an equation or so.  You have to think about many different aspects."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Goal of the week,"it’s a good possibility for the students to do some hands-on work and to see maybe a more complex problem than just, you know...  Before it’s like subject by subject, but then all of a sudden you have different subjects that come together.  So I think it’s good for the students; I can see it’s a good learning experience.  And, I mean, the...  You know, it’s really the question what we should value more – the product or this learning experience?  And I think maybe the learning experience is more important then in retrospective,"
Derek Christie (E3),Goal of the week,"The topic is walking: there’s a basic unity of space and time.  I mean, it’s basically being in this area of Ecublens [?], which is rather special to have an ENAC week, actually, on the campus or in the campus area.  It’s not unique, but some ENAC weeks are in this place, some in other places.  So, apart from the Wednesday, when we went off to Geneva, to visit other... other examples, everything was actually in Ecublens, which is a commune which EPFL is built on.  So, I'm not sure if that answers your question.  Not really?"
Derek Christie (E3),Goal of the week,"yes, is walking; it’s the place; it’s like, an ancient Greek drama, you know, that you have time and place, you know, that don't change.  So there’s that aspect.  Not that it’s really dramatic, but it’s... we know where we are; we know when.  It’s now, it’s not what happened 10 years ago.  What’s going to happen in 10 years.  It’s here, it’s now, it’s about walking.  That goes through.  And this handicapped business was also, I think... although only some of the groups were working on it, I think it impregnated some of the other groups. And my group was on health, and I hope it had some effect on the other groups, though I'm not sure about that.  So, that’s it, I think.  I don't know there’s much else."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Goal of the week,"What really structured around a question and a geographical area. So all students had different topics about the question of pedestrian mobility in this particular area, in the west of the campus. So part… Half of the groups, they had an additional focus on disabled people. And so this Week was clearly, strongly articulated around the specific topic, which was very much… Yes, it was really… It was quite well-defined, the questions, but not the method how to address it, let’s say."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,And Florence was the starting... I mean she started this ENAC week through a project that she will talk to you about as well.  
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So the very first start was a project, we launch with Alan Izbaumer [?] who’s related to a seed money from ENAC faculty.  It was a seed money on urban incentive and the idea was to work on a project that Alan had once developed with a colleague of him and his own bag about the use of containers.  And how does that context and they apply for F&S grant, they didn’t have it.  It was a [inaudible] research and one of the main critic had in the expertise was the luck of social dimension, a cultural dimension of the project.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	So that was the very base of the project where Alan proposed to Eva [inaudible] as a people representing a different lab or institute to try to collaborate together and to launch a new project.  Which includes really our EIJS our competencies about cultural and social dimension.  And so we launch this project we won one of the seed money amongst others and on the same line Alan decided to launch also the ENAC week with a high potential because it includes multidisciplinary project. 
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And so this... All this project plus since 2014 we had some semester project also based globally on the use of containers in different situation and all these different activities actually form actually the core... Basic core of this ENAC.  So all these different project with the help of different teach with also the help of student that did some research, some project help us to organise this project."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,And the ideas of this what we call the COHU project was the incentive seed money was to work on three different case studies of past disaster.  One was in Lebanon was a refugee camp so more social political disaster after a war.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"Another was working on the seismic past catastrophe like and we decided to do it in Ahmadabad in the Gujarat area.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	We did a workshop there and the Alan was much more working on the transformation itself of the container.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And he Alan Izbauma work with one of his colleague from Malaysia from a university technology Malaysia and they did another workshop in Malaysia.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	So the idea was then when we decided to do the ENAC week we thought that it will be worthwhile to locate to situate the ENAC week somewhere abroad."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"And so as we went to the workshop in Ahmadabad in August we decided to use that location to implement our project.  So that was in a way the base of the project, the story behind the project."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"And as Christine is a specialist of contemporary India she worked on many different topic related to local governance and the question of course of the composition of the society.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	The question of the rural area, the urban area, the idea was really to use the EIJS competencies to help and actually to settle down in a way to project."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"SP2	So the first year we work as Christine mentioned before we had five different group so we divided the student in different groups in order to make them becoming a kind of expert...
SP1	Okay.
SP2	In a specific field.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	And then two days after we remixed all the group and the students had to propose us a couple of idea.
SP1	Okay."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"SP1	So you have a really a three year plan sort of in this three steps in three years.
SP2	Yes."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So yes, maybe just to possibly add something about how the ENAC week is also integrated into the project from the Indian perspective.  So as Florence explained we have decided to focus the project or the research project on India.
SP1	Yes.
SP3	And doing also some field work there so the field work had so to say double function, on the one had to fielding to our research I’ll come back to it in a minute.  But on the other hand also to provide some data, some material for the ENAC week."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So I think here what we could highlight is really the strong interrelations between research and teaching in terms of how we also designed a week but also how we designed a field work in India to really be...
SP2	To nourish the...
SP3	Yes, exactly.
SP2	The week."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"SP3	And on the other hand how would public authorities accept, finance, you know, push for such a solution?  So we had both the social culture and the political dimension in our project."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,So we started together last year.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"t was really the exploration first in a kind of theoretical perspective, try to understand it and then of course the second year was more to work on it.  So explore the transformation, concrete transformation of the container so that was a maybe the motto of the..."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,I think what is also nice is that each year as it is a three year project each year is really different.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"Yes, electronically but this year I don’t know if you mention it, this year we decided not to do a booklet but to do posters.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	Yes.
SP2	And the poster will be shown during the entire year in the construction site as well.
SP1	Okay, so this is for preparation.
SP2	Yes, exactly and the idea is that next year the student will have both sources, material to move on actually to go..."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,And I think we had the chance to start with a grant because we had to learn each other during one year in a way a little bit doing exploratory workshop trying to understand the issues.  And the difficulties you can challenge and we can face to and then it was maybe much more easy to imagine...
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"Well I think the story is that they had a research programme about the scenery in the ENAC Week, which was transform a shipping container into a habitation after an earthquake or something like this.  This is great as a research programme, what my role in this was, we had another, what I told you yesterday, teaching unit, ENAC teaching unit, so we tried to transpose our tactical [?] organisation to the ENAC Week.  
	So what we decided is we split the Week in two parts, the first is that the students become kind of specialists of one of the proposed schemes and then in the second part as every specialist they worked together with the other students to make, develop a project.  So the first... Last year we did about two days a kind of formational apprenticeship of what, for the different themes, we had in the ENAC Week and about three days were kept to work together.  "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"This year we tried to change a little bit as we had to the opportunity to realise the building [?], we had 13 container and we wanted to make a reconstruction, so we’ve shortened the first part to one day or less than one day, to very quickly to can start with the second part, so they had to... "
Michael Lehning (E11),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"when I started here that was exactly when they felt that they need a few of new ideas and few new ENAC Weeks, so Marc actually asked me to develop that as one of the teaching obligations at EPFL."
Michael Lehning (E11),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,I think since the main requirement was that it’s interdisciplinary and involves the different disciplines the first really demanding task that I had solve was to get the team together.
Michael Lehning (E11),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So basically it was a little bit of a bottom up approach we, I though what are the key competences in terms of very general architecture, building physics, economics and natural environmental sciences and then we got the team together.  And then as a team we thought about, okay now what we are exactly going to do.  It was always, from the very beginning, we had this idea or I had this idea to put the landscape of the roles [?] in the focus of that and to do something locally there that has a relationship with the Alpine environment, in particular the snow because that’s out main subject.  But including these other aspects of architectural or energy, renewable energy.  It also came at a time when Switzerland was thinking to get out of the nuclear power and so it was also that timely, a timely way to develop that"
Luisa Pastore (E9),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"My personal impression is that I felt there was a growing interest in working on alpine climate, which was something not really explored before. And Davos is quite a representative place because they have this… I mean they actually applied in terms of policy, at the policy level, a lot of solutions for integrating renewable energy sources, and to try to really move towards this path of sustainability. So I think they really wanted to have the integration of different expertise, and not only related to that centre that’s based there in Davos.
	And so, yes, I tried to work on the development of best practice to be applied in the built environment, in that type of environment. And I think the person who were the main driver and organises the ENAC week were essentially Mishy [?] and Hendrik, I guess."
Philippe Belanger (E13),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"What was your impression how this idea about the idea evolved?  What was the process behind it?
SP2	It was very iterative.  The first year, we had the idea of… There is a snow-oriented idea at the very beginning.  It’s the approach that I…  And, in fact, it was not me in my lab that has been approached, it was another, a colleague who did the thing about climate change, snow coverage and economic impact.  Some economies that do general equilibrium models, and they found out that, well, climate change and low Earth, no coverage is good for Switzerland, in a general equilibrium model.  Because other countries will be more impacted than Switzerland, so the demand will go to Switzerland and the price will increase and the value added will increase. So that was that kind of research and it is why he has been contacted by that time.  And he had no time, and he asked me if I wanted to do something, and I said oh yes. "
Philippe Belanger (E13),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"But at the beginning the idea to go to Davos and stuff like that, it’s clearly Michy’s idea and to focus on the renewable energy is clearly Michy.  I really believe that the importance of economic and finance in the project is coming from, initially from Michy.  I think, I like to believe that I convinced the rest of the team that it’s important that my… And I think with… I don’t see all the evaluation, it’s Hendrik that looks at that, but sometimes Hendrik says that students say that it’s the only place where they do economics and finance in their programme.  It’s in the basic introduction, but… It’s a basic introduction but they have a… Those that get involved in that part of the project get… And which is, like, very high value added for the few times that we spend on the subject.  "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"what was your personal, your own main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?
SP2	I would say in our case it was slightly... Well all cases are particular I assume.  I got involved when shortly after Mihi [?] arrived here as a prof and he was kind of building up his teaching activities.  And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from... More the lead on Mihi to get involved in something.  And this seemed to be to me a good opportunity as an interdisciplinary course to learn something about the faculty and something beyond my own field. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So we set up a concept for a version one I should say that first Semaine ENAC was in 2012 for us so we... This year we had addition number five.  So we can also, we have a little tradition already so that we can definitely talk about an evolution.  The evolution was linked a little bit to the teaching staff where we had over the years a bit of fluctuation.  Some people joining, some people leaving and of course this always brings a little bit different... New elements in a way but we did not change the overall topic that remained.  But I think from year to year we got a bit more professional and more experience.  The topics remained, we also saw after the first one or two editions what was feasible, what we can ask for, what they can do in a week.  And I think at the end as I said we... The topic did not change so much, that means we did in my opinion a pretty good choice at the beginning.  Which was fairly well thought because the very first year we really spent a lot of times, we had long documents and we were circulating these documents between teaching staff part of... Or teachers of this particular Semaine ENAC.  And tailored it such that we really integrated elements from all three sections.  So in this sense I think there was not a major turn but every year we optimised a bit. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So we had a couple of ideas that we wrote down and we had a kind of draft programme and this was circulating and people added what they thought was their competence, their contribution.  But also elements that were probably missing at this stage to make it really attractive to all three sections and to make it interdisciplinary.  "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,But overall I don’t see that we made a lot of major turns in the last five years.
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So I saw that call, and thought it would be a good idea.  And then, you know, it was just I think brainstorming about how that could be put into place.  
And I think the idea of kind of making seemed a natural way to work.  And then, you know, the question of kind of what they make, what they could build became an important one, or an interesting one.  And I had seen that there was a competition that I think ENAC sponsored to build a bridge out of toothpicks.  
Or something like this that they do every year, where architects and sometimes engineers end up doing some proposed, you know, a model that they then have to use to carry a certain weight.  So that made me think something in that context.  
But I wanted it to be at a larger scale.  And I wanted it to be at the scale of an actual object that would have an actual function, also.  And then, the idea of the cantilever was just something that I had been thinking about.  Obviously, just as an interesting kind of structural idea, which has also certain kinds of implications, in terms of kind of its representational or representative qualities.  
So it brought together kind of structural ideas with architectural ideas with also, in terms of building that out of wood.  I think, you know, this idea of kind of resources or materials, and what that would mean to work with that."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,So it was different last week because we didn’t have those interventions.  
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"Definitely last year, it was in conversation certainly with my colleagues in ALIS.  We kind of, when we wrote the proposal we thought about the lectures quite a bit.  And you know, I think we never were able to fully carry them out.  And certainly this year they were a bit different. "
Urs von Gunten (E17),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week," the initiator was from the civil engineering department and I think he had some connections with people in India, where they had this site where they wanted to construct it, so I was basically just on board because of my expertise in the water field."
Urs von Gunten (E17),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week," the initiator, he sort of made a, like a rough planning of this week, and then we had several discussions about, you know, what one could do in this week.  And, you know, this ENAC week on one topic goes for three years.  So in the first year the idea was to gather some background material to have some first ideas how to do it.  In the second year – this was this year – the students actually started to construct these containers, and next year this will be finalised."
Tom Battin (E16),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"And I was not involved in that very early process, actually. "
Tom Battin (E16),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"That was Luca Pattaroni and Barbara Tirone, I think.  I think these two, they were more or less the hands behind this.  And so they contacted me essentially because it was about water.  And so I got quite excited about that.  And but then, rapidly I got, like, part of the, like, I got involved in the preparation process, of course.  "
Tom Battin (E16),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"t was particularly, like, I think the target, of course, was like, the Valais [non-English].  So because this is like, the locals, and given that it was quite clear that we should work on, like, barrage impoundments [?] and [non-English], I don’t what the English name is,"
Tom Battin (E16),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"I got fully kind of involved, especially when, you know, when we kind of discussed the transversal subjects, like, construction, [inaudible] and production.  So there I got fully involved. "
Tom Battin (E16),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"a couple of meetings with everybody around the table.  So all the teachers, etc., were there.  And so that was really kind of a common effort."
Tom Battin (E16),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"so there was not a clear distribution of tasks, which is good at the end, I think because this was like, a kind of a free flowing process, so yes.  "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So, after second year in Brussels [?], we were slowly thinking that it would be interesting to change the subject, and especially because we publish this little booklet and, so two in a row [?], I think we were like, kind of, starting to exhaust our [unclear]. Well, not exactly exhaust, but on a broad level, yes, it was a way of exhausting it because there was not so many new subjects students could investigate. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week," was in touch, in contact with this artist from Geneva. And we developed a project on democracy, territory and focused on the question of water in the desert in California, and in Valais [?]. And I was there, I was [unclear] in Valais and so was explaining the project and really, his idea was also to work with engineers and stuff like that. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"And especially because at that time I was also developing a project of collaboration with the School of Art and Design in Geneva. And so when we started thinking about the ENAC week, we already had the idea to have a collaboration with School of Art and Design, which is what happened in that ENAC week. And so the, yes, so it’s really become quite [unclear], especially [unclear] in the relations device, examining water was a good subject to touch on [?], on various subjects. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"	Yes, exactly. That’s what happened. I had to convince… My colleagues were engaged in the ENAC week in Brussels because we did it with the same team. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week," or to a certain extent there were not enough engineering. Engineering was a bit compensated with [unclear] question [?] of public transportation, infrastructures "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"And so we had also in mind that we needed maybe to find a subject that would be more open to environmental sciences, water [unclear] seemed a good idea. But then we had to find the right people, and one of the things that really worked well, it’s the fact that Barbara Tirone [?] was part of the teaching, unique of the ENAC week. She was sharing at that moment with Tom Battin [?], who is a newly appointed professor at EPFL. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"idn’t go with that, so we were a bit poor in relation with representatives [?] from other unit, though we had someone from [unclear] and, but not any more from genie civil. We had, partly because we always been working with Golem [?], who’s in genie civil with… I don’t know if it’s genie "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"o the, so I decided also to include another architect with a specialist in mapping, and who was Barbara Costa."
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So we already had a [unclear] and Barbara Tirone, but I’ve seen the work from Barbara Costa through the students of [unclear]. And so I discussed with [unclear] because I was very impressed, because I was following in [unclear] and PDM in master [?] [unclear] architecture. And I was impressed by their work and so I say, okay, I want you to work with that person, and so she joined us. And so we thought we had enough strengths with mapping, and we were helped before the week from people from [unclear]. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"nd so we worked with [unclear] lab, but before the week, but they did not come during the week. And that’s, yes, that was [unclear]. So yes, that’s about more or less the way we decide and then we find a team. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"Well, there’s one more layer to it, and because we also while we are looking for other laboratories, for new laboratories outside of the one we were already working with, we were also developing the connection with the School of Art and Design. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"And what I’ve done, it’s proposed bit of money to Savalle Gelpas, outside of the presents, of the change [unclear] during the week. So we made a deal about, I think, 3000 SFr. So like 2000 SFr [?] for the week and 1000 SFr for the proprietary work. Savalle Gelpas was interested to develop that project because it was in relation with his more polar artistic project. But it was necessary to pay someone, that was also because he has lots of collection in Valais. "
Derek Christie (E3),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week," but in a more general sense, something to do with public space – [French].  And she wanted to transform that into something more specific on walking.  And we had already been in contact to discuss my PhD thesis project, which is on urban walking."
Derek Christie (E3),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"it was very much Dominique Van der Meulen’s story, and her child, so to speak.  Because she created this ENAC week on public space.  I can remember its exact name: she kept it going for several years, I think it was doing pretty well.  And then she was willing to take this risk to make a bit different.  To capitalise from the fact that I was working on walking and that Emmanuel also has an interest in walking – Emmanuel Ravalet.  So, I think she saw the opportunity to put our strengths, and perhaps weaknesses, together, to create something new.  "
Derek Christie (E3),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"her motivation.  For me, I’ve always been working off and on in research, scientific research, and I've done very little teaching up until now.  So it was an opportunity to get to collaborate and work with students, which is something I’ve done at the secondary school level quite a bit, but never at university"
Derek Christie (E3),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"first time we did it, was last year, so 2015.  There was actually a group of four of us: there was Dominique Van der Meulen; Emmanuel Ravalet, me and a fourth guy called, Tebo Homanie [?].  And that, to be honest, I think it didn’t work out that well in 2015, for, I don't know what reasons.  We didn’t actually have a really serious debriefing to talk about it, which is a bit unfortunate. "
Derek Christie (E3),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So, instead of being four people trying to more or less at the same level, when we weren’t, because it was something really coming from Dominque.  This year it was really... everyone had their own role.  And I am a specialist in public health, among a couple of other things, do I try to bring that public health aspect, which, obviously, is an important part of walking."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,"So the Week certainly evolved from the ideas of the main persons who are organising it. What I can say is that the Week is evolving, so meaning that there was a huge difference between this year and last year in terms of the topic, so it was still around pedestrians but this year it had had a very specific focus also on disabled people. And what I clearly know is that this evolution of the topic is because all those external people from outside came and asked EPFL whether some students could work on the question."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),History & conceptualisation of the ENAC week,need from outside to study the specific aspect of disabled pedestrian
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"Well one aspect is the [inaudible] from the three sections that worked together. Then the second is that we, within one project we tried to have a lot of different aspects, structural aspects, production aspects and section aspects, we had one group from Environmental Engineering about water treatment.  So all this kind of themes to put this all together in one project, and everyone had a small role within a global project."
Michael Lehning (E11),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,But it’s also interactions with the students already because we give them quite a lot of freedom to develop their own creative projects initially which I think is an important aspect of that particular Week.
Michael Lehning (E11),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"But let them develop their concept with the, with a real task that every discipline is represented in the project, so the project should have an energy related part, a physics related part, an environmental related part, an economic part and an architectural part.  And so that’s a requirement and we also judge the initial ideas that they come up with, with respect, and then try to correct where it’s necessary."
Michael Lehning (E11),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"Okay and so coming back to the inter-disciplinary thing, what do you think is the key inter-disciplinary aspect of your week, generally speaking?
SP2	The key aspect is that they have to develop one project, so say a house for example or a cable car installation or something, but it’s one project where we cover all the inter-disciplinary aspects that are related to that project.  So they have to do the economic assessment, if it makes economic sense, they have to make the design, the architectural or design aspect of it and they have to, it has to be renewable so they have to look at it from an environmental side and an energy side, so they have to do calculations, is the energy input sufficient for what they want to achieve, is the house self-sufficient with respect to energy or not, is the cable car running on solar only, is that possible, how much storage do you need.  "
Luisa Pastore (E9),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"So, as I said, working with the built environment and the way of the transformation of the city is interdisciplinary by definition, and so students really learn how to bring and reconsider their specific expertise in a multi-criteria design project. So this is, I think, the key interdisciplinary aspect of that, so it’s…
	But I would also say that it’s both from the students side, but also from the teaching side, or also for us as the teachers it’s very interesting to get involved and to still learn something new about other aspects. So it’s definitely a twofold learning along this process."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"what is the key interdisciplinary aspect of this special week? What do you think?
SP2	I think, again, sustainability in general because they need to have a design which is sustainable, but also have other solution which are sustainable, so… Sustainability for energy production and in buildings, I think, that’s the key of this. Yes."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"what would you say what are the key interdisciplinary aspects in the week?  How would you name or define it?  So, for you personally.
SP2	Before, it’s clearly that, like I told you, they don’t have any contact with economic or financial, so just the basic competency is to… And opening on a reality that is not theirs yet.  So, and a reality that they will face in their professional life.  So I really think that it’s that aspect that will, that competency that is really… And, I mean, the architects are very artists-oriented.  The engineers are really mathematics-oriented.  So there is this inter-competency, this interdisciplinary, like, sharing.  They have to get into a common ground, and it’s never hard, at least for the part of engineers versus architects.  Sometimes for the economics there is some resistance, the students, they don’t like the capitalist guy.  But that’s also very valuable to bring back the architect on the side of the realistic thing, and bringing the civil engineer on the side of, well, we still need to produce something that will be part of the landscape"
Philippe Belanger (E13),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"they’re the only place where the… Well, it’s about the only place where they have to work with other paradigms, so they have to figure out, and that’s… And just the fact that I’m not sure that they do it to have a project in which you have to build from zero.  Okay, architects do it all the time, but they don’t have… They rarely have to face some technical [inaudible] questions, like which the engineers always do, but… And they don’t have to face the economic guy that says, oh no, that does not sense.  Oh, it’s a good project.  No, it’s not a good project because there is no value into it.  So that kind of…"
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"And well so last question for this part which are the key or is the key interdisciplinary aspect of your week?  How would you describe it?
SP2	We tried to put as much of these aspects in the title of the Semaine ENAC, the title was a little longer, I think a few years ago and then the academic service said you have 140 characters or whatever and we had to reduce.  So I think our original idea was to group the interdisciplinary aspect around two key words.  One is renewable energy and this is really applied to different scales, like from the smallest scale of having a small standalone unit to large scale energy production.  Or energy storage in the landscape.  And the second element is I would say sustainability, again, in a very large sense sustainability with respect to or applied to landscape and a natural environment and to build infrastructure.  And bringing all these together I think we have two elements that give a wealth of questions, interesting and relevant to the students of the three sections.  Because all of them are concerned with energy question, the architects when designing buildings, the civil engineers anyway for maybe power production.  The environmental engineering... Engineers as well for also handling energy, transmission.  
But then also citing of infrastructures work and they put these things where we have natural risks and hazards, how does it integrate in the landscape, how does it integrate with valid regulations and law and so on?  And in this context I should also mention that... And that’s maybe a bit particular of our Semaine ENAC that we are also covering economic aspects which I think is nice and it’s probably for most of them a new element.  They don’t have this in class or anything, we have a dedicated specialist or expert for that and I think it’s a nice component to bring... To develop a project where you also do at least a basic calculation to see that it’s something realistic and maybe viable."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"Certainly all of these people have or they are developing their specific competencies but I think it’s important that they while developing these competencies they go into depth and that they are somehow specialists.  But they have to be specialists that they can interact with neighbour disciplines.  And here we... It’s like a lateral development and a transversal skill I think that they are able to prepare them for the profession.  Because they will have to talk to colleagues of course everywhere and this is a very nice exercise to complement I think what is done in the courses in the specific curriculum which are very... Well, not fully disciplinary but focused, that we open here and create the links to the neighbour disciplines because current research, current practice and in the private and public sectors they... This is how things work so we hope to prepare them for this and this is our understanding of the interdisciplinary component."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week," this project where the civil engineers, they’ll look at the construction of these containers, and the architects, they look at the sort of design and interior of these containers, and we looked at the water part of it.  And I think it was really quite a nice match, truly"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"the water part was a little bit detached from the construction and the architectural part.  And I think the students certainly saw, you know, how the architects work and how the civil engineers work in the construction, and I think this was very instructive.  But I think it was more or less, you know, each discipline would do their job and the others would just get an impression, you know, how this works."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"that’s also quite a useful interdiscliplinarity.  But it, I think it was…  At this level, as I mentioned before, you know, because they are themselves not really experts in their field, it’s very difficult then to get engaged into interdiscipinarity that you would have a sound discussion with an architect how to solve, you know, the water problem, etc, "
Tom Battin (E16),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week," Oh, there was nothing in there from civil engineering, when nobody cares about because it’s about interdisciplinary.  So they need to get better preparation here, plus, I think they need… "
Tom Battin (E16),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"so what were the disciplines there?  So what were the disciplines there?  And I think there was, like, a clear discipline, more from, if you want from the sociology, architecture urbanism, so that was almost like, one axis. "
Tom Battin (E16),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"environmental sciences, even up or down to hydrology, etc., because after all, it was a week on water.  So also, we have one string, which is more like the architectural urbanism.  And linked to this is sociology.  And then, the other one, more the environmental science. "
Tom Battin (E16),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"ike the artist, so represented by [non-English] and [non-English], folks from Geneva, actually.  Plus, what was like, civil engineering as a discipline, was missing as well.  So there was nobody from civil engineering, there was anybody from there, no."
Tom Battin (E16),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"the interdisciplinary was really like, I think, a rather thin thread.  But basically, between urbanism, or landscape is more like urban landscape stuff, architecture, and then, the environmental sciences a little bit.  And like, the art was more a way to, you know how art is.  "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"The whole approach of social technical approach is somehow, makes it an interdisciplinary context, and… But then there is… I think for the groups where they integrated also artistic expression, I think that was an interesting element because they also had to understand how the parameter they were working could find other ways of expressing itself. You know. The kind of, the slope of the biss [?], you know, which is a strong technical question. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"So it’s, yes, [unclear] interdisciplinary as also a way to open up. And then it was interdisciplinary in a way that we should look at all the work done, but there was this very well integration of elements of values discipline, you know, so it’s more an interdisciplinary as a collection of knowledge. And that was quite well done. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"here’s always testimonies of students saying that they kind of better understand the way their colleagues think, you know, and we have seen that. And you also see the confrontation and they are these groups where they have, they work [?] on these dams, and then it was very sequential and the project have done [?]."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"poorest way to have interdisciplinary question, and especially because in that group, maybe it was… But I don’t think it was on the whole group level, but there was a couple of them, especially one student from civil engineering who really stuck to his own knowledge, you know, and [unclear]. He was doing a presentation of something very rigid, ripe [?], it’s like producing the engineer image of the dam. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"The others were really able to include in general representation within a, for example, moral [?] sketch from artists or from architect. And so when you start to feel that the work they’ve done is more loser interlinked, when you discuss with them that you understand. They kind of share a common understanding of the… Then you can start to have something more transdisciplinary."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"The level of entanglement for me was [unclear]. But also the understanding that the other react [?] as architect or engineer [?], and they find that they can try to overcome that type of first reaction and learn also to understand the other [unclear] process of learning process. "
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"... all of it’s inter-disciplinary, as I said, trans-disciplinary.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"t’s not... it doesn’t really rest, I think, on the key identity of the three types of student we have.  We have... you know, our students of architecture; [French] civil engineering; and environment.  They are relatively young students, so they don't necessarily already have a strong identity, they’re just acquiring it.  The architects are a little bit clearer about it, perhaps.  But for the others, I think, they're in the process of building it.  So, you can't really say – this is my personal opinion – that they are... completely self-identifying, as being a civil engineer, and then mixing their competencies with someone who is clearly an environmental engineer.  I think it just doesn’t work like that.  There may be a way of modelling it, which can be useful, on a very aggregate level, but on the ground, it’s not like that at all."
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"they realise that they’re doing different things; they have different approaches, but, when working on a project like this, they are... It’s not a question of being in a strong disciplinary identity and, you know, stepping over or opening their arms to another discipline, it’s just... you know, here’s the observation; here’s the job we’re doing, and the just do it.  Then they happen to realise that somebody’s good at maps, and someone’s good at calculations; and someone’s good at something else.  Which may, or may not, be due to their discipline, maybe due to other things; other projects they’ve done. "
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"So I think they have a trans-disciplinary mind set, from the beginning, which I think is very positive. And I like to think we bring it to them, but to be absolutely honest, I think it comes from them, more than anything.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week," because I've read quite a lot about inter-disciplinary and... You can't, basically..."
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week," you don't have the first step of, you know, being very sure of your own domain before starting to open to others.  These are... they're already opening to others, because they are really defined.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"They... they... one of them even said, when we had our debriefing meeting, they said: you know, we didn’t feel that we were sitting in the meeting with architect written on our heads or something."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"the question itself addresses the question of how we manage our urban landscape, so that in essence is the most… It’s like the classic interdisciplinary topic that you can have at this school, which is having to deal with urban planning, with the environmental aspects, with the construction. So the interdisciplinarity [?] is really given by the topic, s"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Key interdisciplinary aspects of the week,"Think of the different aspects, it just emerges naturally from all they’re doing"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt,"But well I think each team needed to organise itself this year we decided to work more closely with [Inaudible name] as he was in charge of the urbanisation perspective.  And we thought... I mean working on cultural and social dimension of the communities is itself doesn’t make sense if you don’t integrate the progressive urbanisation of the neighbourhood. 
SP1	Sure.
SP2	So this year we work more closely with him so in a way we had at the beginning five team but in a way our two team merged together and we already decided that for next year we will have only four group.  Because our two team with Lazure [?] and I mean urbanisation and cultural and social dimension will again be our work.  Because it makes sense, otherwise you know it’s so... There are so many interlinks that there’s no way to separate it.  Also for the students as their time is very short for student to...
SP1	Sure.
SP2	To integrate all these idea."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt,"maybe one thing will be that to organise, to coordinate the project a little bit more in advance because of for instance this year we had... As we always working on different sub-group, sorry, sometimes my feeling was well maybe you share it, I don’t know.  But my feeling was that we should have a more concrete coordination between the teacher but not to... "
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt,"But and so I think we should have more discuss earlier what was our... I mean from team part of sub-group a outcome from each side.  Because sometimes I had the feeling that the students didn’t know exactly okay, I have to go on this side or I have to do the model.  For them it maybe have been not always very comfortable.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	But it’s... That’s also part of the work in progress."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt, think the first thing I will do if I am newcomer will be to build a team.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt,Because if you’re not... If you don’t have already link with other colleague from other institute or lab it’s quite difficult. 
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt,That’s another thing well... That’s I think it’s very much important and then it’s the combination of the different competencies and of course then you need a federative project.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Lessons learnt,"But I think that’s also nice idea to work on another side of only the EPFL side.
SP1	Yes."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Lessons learnt," but the others they came and... But the relation of our course is that perhaps we hadn’t been that ready, that we did not know how the students worked and how... It was a kind of an experience, so we had to improvise a lot."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Lessons learnt,"And then, what we had, probably we planned too much work that the students aren’t so efficient, we had to do less or prepare less, so perhaps more time to do it, to really, to finish it, as they did not really finish within the time"
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Lessons learnt,"So we tried, we discussed it already and we’ll try next year to make everybody of the students to come and do something on the building."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Lessons learnt,"Yes perhaps we should have a better clarification [?] ourselves from the teaching staff, "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Lessons learnt,"Well the difficulty is that it’s trans-disciplinary, so they have to be, the first thing they have to do is to find other people from other disciplines and then they have to be very open to work with them.  So you have to be open to see what, how others work and how... To find an idea also that everybody can, it’s open for everybody [inaudible], which is the main problem.  [Inaudible], not ENAC Week, but ENAC teaching units, which is more or less the same, so you go from the idea, basic idea, but you need a theme that can bring as well architects, civil engineers and environmental engineers together.  And you have to have a theme that everybody works more or less on the level.  And this is not always easy.  If you have this, then you have to find some people that have some time to work together and it’s not a problem.  "
Michael Lehning (E11),Lessons learnt,"it’s still dynamic in the sense that you adjust it a little bit every year and try to keep, you know, not doing exactly the same thing."
Michael Lehning (E11),Lessons learnt,"the first version was already quite successful.  
	And it seemed the key to success there was that we were available during the Week to guide the students in their individual development and steps, so we were sort of very closely following what they were actually doing.  And I think that’s a key for success in that particular format because if we give them the freedom then we want to make sure that they don’t run off doing something completely stupid, and then it’s important that you follow them closely during the Week.  
	And they’re also flexible, so for example, we had to, I remember in the first year we had to go out and buy materials for them for building the models which wasn’t there, and so since we, you know, we were able to do that and pull it off at short notice, that worked out."
Michael Lehning (E11),Lessons learnt,"So I think the challenging thing is that it’s not an artificially... The recipe for success there is that it’s not an artificial inter-disciplinary project, but it’s really a real object that they need to generate that has these different aspects to it or pretty close to what they’re hopefully going to be experiencing in their real professional life later."
Michael Lehning (E11),Lessons learnt,"And I think that another lesson for us is that the better we have certain preconfigured data sets the easier the week is going, because it’s almost asking too much if we give them fairly raw stuff because, you know, they are not used to, they are not yet in a research environment that they can very quickly reformat data or get them in a different software. 
	So in order to give them a chance to really develop their ideas to some rightness [?], the amount of time to spent in simple tasks such as data formatting or preparation should be limited."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Lessons learnt,"So I actually also contributed, since I got involved the last year, proposing this new themes for this Semaine ENAC, of the design of the micro and temporary architecture. That was quite successful because the students found it very, yes, creative, something that you can once in a while go out of the box and invent something and try to, yes, like sort of exaggerate, but in good terms during this week. So also having some fun."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Lessons learnt,"So I think that the… Everything went well in general, but probably what can be better organised are the experimental part. So we really found out with basically some small adjustment, we could, and some small tricks, we can offer bigger opportunities for the experimental part. 
	And since there are lots of equipments and, yes, structure that can be used there, it will be a really… I mean if you just bring more samples of insulation materials, for example, or something that they can play with along the week, ventilators or some really small…
SP1	Basic.
SP2	Yes, basic things can be very helpful for them, so, yes."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Lessons learnt,"well, from my side I could say that after two years I’m much more involved into the project, so I know what to expect also from the students. And to me it was much more easier to follow the projects, and I guess for next year will be even easier if I would ever be there."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Lessons learnt," So that project evolved with the reality that surrounds Davos and the different data that we have.  So that’s interesting and as professor team we get better.  We’re, like, knowing what are the issues that the student will have.  We are able to push a little bit further, like, this three angle roof with the battery, with a lot of iteration to find… The idea was not to really find the right orientation, the right sizing, but to make the student understand that the optimisation of such buildings, green buildings is not that obvious.  It depends on a lot of data on some variability of the data you have.  "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Lessons learnt,"So, kind of, the methods used and the didactical structure of the week, how do you see it?
SP2	I really like it.  I mean, I would change nothing.  Maybe, like we had before the week of the one session of teaching before, but the idea… I would like to be able to do that in my classes, have classes like that in my university.  I would really like to have that kind of teaching.  Like, I mean, in some business schools it’s the usual kind of teaching, like you have… Well, it’s not… It’s more formal but it’s, you have a case study and you have to solve the case and then you present your solution and the professor helps you to, like, figure out what you need to do to improve your solution.  "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Lessons learnt,"We have them work a lot.  It’s not like that in every week, but the popularity of… Everybody knows that we work in our… I don’t know in the recent years, but in the first few years everybody said, we work more in your week than every other week.  You have the report, others just have a presentation.  We have a report.  We ask them to identify who worked on which parts, which other weeks do not do from what I… I don’t know now, but in the first few years it was like that.  But still people come to our week anyway.  It’s always full, it’s one of the first choices, and I really like to have those students that want… People know that they have to work in our week and they come.  So we have the rights to the good students.  We have the students that we would like to have."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Lessons learnt,We have the reputation to be hard makes it so that we have the good students.
Philippe Belanger (E13),Lessons learnt,"So I think that this mix-up and this synergy that we have altogether is the secret of the success, and the fact that we can ask so much to the student and they are still get out of the Semaine ENAC like with the [non-English], that they have realised something.  So they have learned something also, so it’s really… I mean, the fact that we are able to get all this thing that are not as easily put together, together is really the chemistry of the thing.  We are able to… Hendrik goes in with a theme, I go in right after, and there is no… There is, kind of, even though we don’t have the same paradigm, we don’t have the same approach, there is no clash, there is no… Everything, like, fits together like a well oiled mechanism."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Lessons learnt,"So we can also, we have a little tradition already so that we can definitely talk about an evolution.  The evolution was linked a little bit to the teaching staff where we had over the years a bit of fluctuation.  Some people joining, some people leaving and of course this always brings a little bit different... New elements in a way but we did not change the overall topic that remained.  But I think from year to year we got a bit more professional and more experience."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Lessons learnt, And then we have some senior members that are there since a couple of years and some other that are fairly new and hopefully they stay for a few years and that we don’t have to have an exchange every year.  I think it’s also important that if you engage for Semaine ENAC that you do it at least a few years.  To see an evolution at the first year is probably you just learn how to do it and then second year you can be more productive. 
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Lessons learnt,"I think a good documentation is absolutely necessary, we are using the Moodel platform to distribute information documents but also where they can upload material when needed.  So I think this... I mean it can also be something else like a Dropbox or whatever but as EPFL is proposing this as a teaching platform we’re using it and it works quite well.  So it’s very useful.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And so I can recommend it also to other Semaine ENAC to use this as a resource."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Lessons learnt,"that’s still a question for me is what the right balance is, or what the right inputs could be.  And how those kind of more theoretical, those inputs could help.  Yes, so it’s still something that’s up in the air. "
Urs von Gunten (E17),Lessons learnt,"the initiator, he didn’t have enough time to really plan everything thoroughly"
Tom Battin (E16),Lessons learnt,"Exactly, and at the beginning I was a little bit critical at that.  And then, I realised that was a really good idea because also for the students.  Because on Day A, they were confronted to do teaching, Group Teachers A.  And then, during Day B, to the others, so that was a good… 
I think that was a good exercise for them because they would have to argue, right, to really make the point, you know, why they came up with that.  So that’s why they got challenged.  So I think that that was very good, actually. "
Tom Battin (E16),Lessons learnt,"is they were not prepared enough to work in an interdisciplinary, or a multi-disciplinary setting.  So they were not prepared to do so, right?  And that was also part of the critiques that we got back from the students.  But that’s relatively easy to fix for next year. "
Tom Battin (E16),Lessons learnt,"I mean, overall, I’m a big fan of the Semaine ENAC.  And I mean, I learned a lot.  Personally, I learned a whole lot, you know?  But it requires more meetings with the students, more work upstream before we start it."
Tom Battin (E16),Lessons learnt,"how sociologists, how they think about what I’m working on, right?  So the same for those people working in landscape, whatever it is, it’s not landscape ecology.  But it’s like, I don’t know, it’s landscaping or urbanism and city interface, right? "
Tom Battin (E16),Lessons learnt,"But it’s completely different approaches, actually, which I find really intriguing, and even asking slightly different questions.  I learned a lot of from the artists, [inaudible].  So the way they perceived their watery environment, for instance, or the alpine environment.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Lessons learnt,"I saw many unhappy and tired faces, etc., etc.  So it’s like, I think there would be ways to kind of increase the happiness of the students, and also of the teachers, actually, by having perhaps even smaller groups perhaps, better focused subjects."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"But the more free they are, the more disorientated they are, and then they don’t like it. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt," input, of theoretical [?] input to do it. We’ve probably done a little bit too much of that. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"it’s very short and it’s really difficult to find the good balance. And, but then sometimes we have people, we have from the School of Art and Design, we have sociologies [?], we have urban planners and architects, mapping questions. And so we, in a certain way we need to have people expressing perspectives and giving input if you really want to make it interdisciplinary. But then it’s, yes, it has such [unclear]. The more interdisciplinary you do it, the less time you have to, for…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"not so harsh because [inaudible] was so bad, but [inaudible] much less interesting, good as what we had in Brussels. They tired [unclear], to a certain point we were just saying, ask them the questions, you know, if we do that, mean that we should just stay in Lausanne. And anyway, there are some weeks which are very easy going and they get very, really high evaluations. It’s always like that, and if you give…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"till seem to be interested to go somewhere else, and… But it’s true also, the integration of the art students was also another challenge because, first of all because they were not in the same credit system."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"It can be tricky because it can be just to have two strong architects imposing the currents, which is… So it’s, yes, it’s difficult to see and to understand to what level we managed to do something interdisciplinary."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"the final results are quite exciting. I think that they come up as the other week, we… Actually it’s true. We asked them to work quite strongly on the project, and, but they get back… They gave, they turned in some good reports. No, I don’t know what to call them. But yes, they really…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"Especially when you go abroad, because you are, like, staying together and just the simple experience is nice, and"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Lessons learnt,"And then they had to do the mapping, to also look at construction and stuff like that. But there was no, for example, specific assignment for environmental science, you know, an"
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"first time we did it, was last year, so 2015.  There was actually a group of four of us: there was Dominique Van der Meulen; Emmanuel Ravalet, me and a fourth guy called, Tebo Homanie [?].  And that, to be honest, I think it didn’t work out that well in 2015, for, I don't know what reasons.  We didn’t actually have a really serious debriefing to talk about it, which is a bit unfortunate. "
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"Tebo Homanie was not in it, or in it a lot less.  That’s not the reason why it went better, but it... the roles, I think, were better defined.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,this longer period of time 
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"I think that’s a really strong advantage, yes"
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"And this year, it worked out very well because they're all very motivated and they created a lot of stuff.  Some of the stuff was not really what I was expecting in my group.  I was a bit disappointed on some things, but they did other things which I was not expecting.  So, I'm beginning to accept this idea of, kind of, handing the keys over to the students a bit more. "
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt, I’d be more... I’d probably be a bit more direct: that would be my instincts.  
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"But last year, some of the groups didn’t actually do that much work.  We said, you know: basically, you know, you do it; you do what you want to do.  And some of them were just, sort of, non-starters.  So there’s risk... and element of risk in that sort of approach."
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"It was a little bit less open, I think, this year than last year, I think that helped.  And the students, I think, were a bit more motivated.  We’ve no idea why.  Maybe just luck, chance."
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"you need to have a strong team in place from the start.  You need several people, because if one of them is not available, even for one day, it can create problems.  So, we were, basically, three or four, even five people, if you count, really, everybody in the core team.  Plus, almost five others who were... who were on the outside.  So, all in all, you've got 10 people, who have to be coordinated in one way or another.  So, the lessons learnt, I think you do need a certain number of people, a bit of complexity.  But then, only one or two people are actually going to carry the course: in this case it was Dominque and Emmanuel. "
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"10 people, you can't have 10 people organising something like that, so you really need this small core team, supported by several others. "
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"we haven’t...  we didn’t start up this week from scratch, at all.  We were able to build on... build on what Dominique had been doing for 10 or 12 years before, which made things a lot easier, but also, maybe, because it was a change, maybe that’s why the first year didn’t go so well. "
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"she had a team of outside people who would help her, I think, every year.  So those people dropped out: Emmanuel and I came in, and that was difficult, and we had a difficult year."
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,the first thing you would say is: don't do it. 
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt," if you're going to start from scratch, I think you definitely need a team within EPFL.  You need several people on the outside that you can pay and who are reliable.  And you've got to expect that the first year is going to be tough, probably rough riding for everyone – unfortunately.  But, I think there are risks, because we’re asking so much of... there’s so much student participation.  There’s quite a big degree of freedom, so... I mean, it can be great but it’s... I think whoever’s going to start, has to think about: I'm going to do this for two or three years with such and such a group.  This sort of budget; these sorts of people from the outside; possibly and NGO, like we had.  Not people who are going to be here today, gone tomorrow.  Because I think if you just try it for one year and it doesn’t work, you would be tempted to give up."
Derek Christie (E3),Lessons learnt,"it’s very important to feel encouraged by the faculty and the presidency, the vice presidency of the EPFL.  It’s very important to feel that encouragement.  "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Lessons learnt,"The too-short period. So as I said before, on one hand, for the students it’s great because they have to learn to provide output in time. And on the other hand, they always feel frustrated. So they’re very motivated and then they feel frustrated."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Lessons learnt,"they have a meeting before to prepare, but obviously this meeting is just to get to know each other. So… And spending more time on preparation is not the solution, because what makes the whole dynamic is to be together during a week."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Lessons learnt,"it’s very hard to have completely equivalent topics, let’s say. So the students, within the Week, the students choose a topic themselves, we had five. But obviously, you always have topics that are… If they are… For example, everything is new, like, for the disabled pedestrians. It’s much easier to come up with a cool presentation at the end because everything is new, even for the people who are teaching. So it’s very hard to have equivalent topics within the Week."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Lessons learnt,"how the dynamic evolves is really related to how strongly the students get personally involved, and so it’s really a question of what the questions are that you give them and not… Less the location, actually. In the end, they’re very happy to be close to campus because it’s easy to go there."
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Lessons learnt,"Professors, yes. I think the most important thing is to just ask the students to be able to switch off during the Week, from your everyday work. To say okay, I’m really leaving my research aside and getting completely involved in the Week, which to some researchers, professors, is extremely hard"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Lessons learnt,to my background and my personal experience
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Motivation for engagement,I would say motivation or the engagement was due to the fact that we are at the College of Humanities.  This institute which is basically a social science and humanities unit at EPFL.  And we would... I mean our mission and our motivation is to collaborate and to integrate teams at EPFL with this interdisciplinary where at least multidiscipline dimensions.  So this was really the core motivation so the interdisciplinary aspect of the ENAC week was I would say the core feature that really motivated us.  And perhaps also vice versa for the rest of the team having also this social dimension in it would bring value into the whole project.
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Motivation for engagement,"That was the idea and so the idea as the someone in ENAC have receive a high potential, the idea was to do it three year because there was some money for that"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Motivation for engagement,"So that was originally the idea to show the process of and it was also in link with the incentive which was a re-urbanisation incentive.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	The grant that we receive in 2014.
SP1	Okay, yes."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Motivation for engagement,"The ENAC Week was organised, introduced by [inaudible], which are two other colleagues, we had another course, another ENAC course together so they asked me to come into this course.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	As an architect, because they needed an architect, about the construction and about material side and so on."
Michael Lehning (E11),Motivation for engagement,"Well first of all I think I like the idea that was behind the ENAC idea that we have different groups, interdisciplinary groups of students that worked together so basically saying this is not a good idea if the engineer meets the architect the first time in a real project, on a real construction site.  And so there was good in an engineering curriculum that they get to talk to each other early in their formation so that they have an idea what the other mindset basically is."
Michael Lehning (E11),Motivation for engagement,"I mean first of all of course we were all volunteered by Marc Provence [?] at the time who was pushing for that and when I started here that was exactly when they felt that they need a few of new ideas and few new ENAC Weeks, so Marc actually asked me to develop that as one of the teaching obligations at EPFL.  And so I thought about it and it was, I thought it was a really good idea and also, since we are at SLF in the role [?] as part of the WSL we are also used to work close to application oriented research.  I was also motivated by that so that, it gives a good bridge and we want to have the students work on demand environment and so there were several good aspects for motivation."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Motivation for engagement,"What’s your main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?
SP2	So, there are a few reasons why I choose to be involved in this Semaine ENAC. First of all because I was interested in improving my teaching skills so it was for really personal interest. And I was really excited to work in an interdisciplinary environment because throughout my education… So both my master’s degree in architectural engineering which is already kind of hybrid and interdisciplinary by definition, and then a PhD as an engineer, got in the Department of Architecture, carrying out a thesis which focused on environmental design, was already sort of in keeping on working on interdisciplinarity in my studies. 
And so I became more and more aware of the importance of interdisciplinarity today, which in the field of construction and building environment in general is definitely essential. So both at the research and professional level, and started to be considered also as an essential framework for the teaching practice.
Also I wanted to give myself this challenge, I found it very interesting, and I also liked a lot the fact of coupling theory and practice, that I thought was very interesting as well. 
And also having some fun, so having some regenerative time with the students in a different environment and out of the usual and daily routine standards of academic, yes, routine."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Motivation for engagement,"What was your motivation to engage in the ENAC week?
SP2	 So, honestly, I was a master student here in this group, in LIPID, and I was followed by Parag who was involved in the course before me. So he was going to finish and he was saying, I would like you to follow my path so why don’t you start to do that. 
But actually I wasn’t a PhD yet, so I started even before being a PhD, and then when I became a PhD I just continued to do the Semaine ENAC. Even if it’s completely different from what I’m doing, but I… Because I want to be broad in my studies so I feel like it’s a great opportunity for me to exploit the different areas of, yes, building physics still, but different."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Motivation for engagement,"So, again as I told you before, it is something not related to my topic, but to me it’s enriching because every time also working with students, I’m learning stuff. And each project is unique so it helping me also for the future to maybe understand different problems. For me it’s like I was doing all the projects, so it was nice. Of course I was not solving their problems, but at the end I was kind of involved. So to me it was… It’s enriching also for me, of course.
SP1	That’s great.
SP2	Yes, in a really different topic so not related to my PhD but in general I think at the end of my PhD I just don’t want to be an expert in a really tiny part of building physics, so I would like to have a broader knowledge. And it is also always useful to have, I think, so I like to do that also for this reason."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Motivation for engagement,"First of all, the main motivation.  Why did you engage in the ENAC Week?  Did and do, still?
SP2	Did, at the beginning it was because they asked me if I wanted to do some economic stuff about snow and impact of snow.  So at the beginning it was really just for snow.  The approach was about snow and it turned out to be, like, an initiation into economics to finance for engineers.  And it’s very nice that this, the few first years I learned a lot about how did the engineers see the things and stuff, and what I can bring them.  So that’s why I’m still involved, and there are a few research projects that we are still talking about that may come out of the Semaine ENAC. "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Motivation for engagement,"And there’s also the message that I try to put forward that, you know, a lot of engineers and architects, it’s all, money is not our thing, it’s not important.  Well, when you end up in the work market you will realise that it’s important.  But even for the environment it’s important because you have a limited amount of resources and you want to have the biggest impact with that limited resources.  So this extra panel should be placed on another project, not in a project where it’s not useful, where the cost versus the value is very high. "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Motivation for engagement,"Every year there is one, two, three, the one team that want to push it a little bit further, and… I mean, as a teacher it’s what you want.  It’s… You live, you do that for those students.  It’s the student that wants to get more, that wants to do this, oh you could do this extra thing.  It’s not necessary but you could do it to see what happens.  And the student that wants to do that extra thing, you live for that. "
Philippe Belanger (E13),Motivation for engagement,"I don’t know who at the base, at the beginning decided to have Josep, me and Hendrik, and Parag in the team, but it ends up that we were meant to work together in this Semaine ENAC.  And I really hope that I can continue to contribute to the Semaine ENAC. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Motivation for engagement,"what was your personal, your own main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?
SP2	I would say in our case it was slightly... Well all cases are particular I assume.  I got involved when shortly after Mihi [?] arrived here as a prof and he was kind of building up his teaching activities.  And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from... More the lead on Mihi to get involved in something.  And this seemed to be to me a good opportunity as an interdisciplinary course to learn something about the faculty and something beyond my own field. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Motivation for engagement,"we had really good appreciation of the Semaine ENAC and that keeps us motivated to do it.  If people would come because it’s under curriculum and everybody hates it then it would be also like a disaster for us.  And the fact that already from the first edition it was a success, gave us the motivation to say okay, let’s... Of course we’re available to do it once again and we will improve and we optimise it. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Motivation for engagement,We also see that despite the workload it’s a success because I think from what I heard we are always among the top three in terms of enrolments and this is confirmation that we should continue like this.
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Motivation for engagement," I had seen the call for kind of submissions or proposals for new ideas for the ENAC week.  And it seemed, you know, again, the idea of bringing the architects together with engineers in the context of a single week.  I think also that was interesting that it was something intensive that happened over a period of five days."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Motivation for engagement,"I think I also think that’s a useful structure.  One that lets you to take certain liberties, or do certain experiments that you wouldn’t be able to do on a weekly basis.  So I saw that call, and thought it would be a good idea."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Motivation for engagement,"I was intrigued by the, this possibility to work together with architects and engineers to see – or civil engineers – to see how they work."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Motivation for engagement,"I personally find it’s quite...  I found it quite rewarding to do it,"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Motivation for engagement,"Despite all the, you know, negative points that I mentioned, I think – you know, one could optimise it, but I think it’s still quite rewarding to do it, and also to have a more close contact with the students for a week"
Tom Battin (E16),Motivation for engagement,"Disciplinary work, also like, teaching across the boundaries of the various disciplines, which I think is one of the strengths of EPFL.  And so for me it was very clear and easy from the very beginning on, you know, seeing as I’m pretty new here, as well, to say yes, let’s do that.  So it was quite clear.  So it’s really this kind of, like, for me, it’s interdisciplinary. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Motivation for engagement,"I was interested in teaching to bachelor students, which was one of the motivation because I teach mostly at master and PhD level. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Motivation for engagement,"the idea of having the society of, having everyone together for one week. I think it’s an interesting [unclear] tool, and my colleagues were doing it for years and they were always quite excited by the experience. And it’s also an interesting experience for the teachers, for the professors or the teaching team because you also get together, especially because we go away from Lausanne."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Motivation for engagement,"lso the subjects we could touch, you know, because the two ENAC weeks, the first two ENAC weeks I was leading, where on Brussels [?] at night, and so there was a unique occasion to have students to go inside the city and to really experiment on a first person base. And for me it was interesting to link band [?] planning and actual question with social sciences, but based on a real experience of the field. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Motivation for engagement,"ethnographical field, which is something which is very, also quite common in Paris [?], universities around the world. And for me it was a unique experience to really understand what field work is."
Derek Christie (E3),Motivation for engagement," I was brought on board by Dominic Van der Meulen [?].  I didn’t even know what an ENAC week was before, since I... didn’t study at the EPFL.  So, I don't really know very much about the teaching here.  I really came in as a researcher, and I happened to be working on walking, and Dominique Van der Meulen wanted to do a week on...  and ENAC week on walking. "
Derek Christie (E3),Motivation for engagement,"It was more the desire to work on urban walking, than the desire to do an ENAC week.  If it had been a regular teaching mandate during the whole year, or during the semester, for me, it would have been pretty much the same, as far as the motivation is concerned.  It’s more the content I was interested in."
Derek Christie (E3),Motivation for engagement,"I said, I didn’t even know anything about the form, so... yes, that wasn’t a criterion at all."
Derek Christie (E3),Motivation for engagement," I had a motivation for teaching and working on walking.  Yes... but it was, kind of, experimental. "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Motivation for engagement,"I thought it’s an extremely interesting experience to get closer to students to see how they work, to get involved in teaching. And also, I mean, if you don’t have to teach, it’s maybe not the best thing to go in a formal [?] lecture, so this kind of experience is probably the best experience to… Yes, to work with students without having to do a lot of classwork, basically."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"Yes well actually as we mentioned before there was a general plan and then we had some sub-group in a way to provide some expert.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And the idea was that each sub-group organise itself and we had some meeting point during the week to you know, to try to have all the information together.  "
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"Makes sense.  And these different groups are then specialists as I understood for a certain part of the project or...
SP2	Yes.
SP1	And is there some kind of synthesis in the end or...
SP2	Yes, so we do have regular critical point we set critical meeting where we gather all together.
SP1	Yes.
SP2	The students can present some first findings.
SP1	Okay.
SP2	And so they share with all of the group and then we reorganise them into groups so they can each expert can be part of a group."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"This year as Christine mentioned as we work more on the concrete transformation of the containers we decided first to have two groups then we had only one group.  But in the group, the big group that works on the construction site they had different task again."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"Okay, so sub-groups.
SP2	Yes, so kind of sub-groups but at least we had only one project altogether."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"SP2	Actually they had when we went this year we went much more on the construction site."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"And they needed to organise their work for the others and then we had sub-group, one working on the rooftop, the other one working on the construction of mall... Wall, sorry.  A group of students did a firework to cook actually so we had some cooking session for lunch."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"SP3	So there was milestones, we had meetings and discussion on site every morning."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"And the... I mean basically the first kind of, yes, after the first day where the groups were split into five so that every group on site, on the construction site would have an expert of every five dimension.  The students and this was on Tuesday, I think noon, that we finally, I mean we agreed on the project itself, I mean how the container... Containers, because there are two of them, would look like at the end of the week.
SP1	Yes.
SP3	So this project was... Is the result of the work of the five groups on their each own dimension and then how I mean collectively the students decided with our guidance..."
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,"	Were there some theoretical input lectures from teaching... From teachers?  Or were there just the...
SP3	That was the first day.
SP2	At the beginning, yes, at the very first day, yes.
SP3	And what we did was also to you know we met, we had the first meeting with the students on the nineteenth of April if I remember well.
SP2	Yes.
SP3	And on the nineteenth of April we gave the students, I mean we met the five groups already so that they started working on their dimension already before the start of ENAC week.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	And so each faculty working on the dimension also instructed the students of some readings that they needed to do, also theoretically.
SP1	Yes.
SP3	So that on the first day of the week ENAC when we kind of gave this theoretical introduction to the first to the whole class we had a first two hour lecture but it was more of a seminar.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	And then we had the five groups with every responsible for half a day or six hours and then again we met collectively.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	So on the Monday the students in each group were already familiar with, I mean were supposed to be through what we also exposed on the nineteenth of April where we had like maybe 25 minutes each group responsible to start introduce our theme.
SP1	Okay.
SP3	Then the readings on the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth of, the first day, twenty-fifth I think the first day of the ENAC week.  I mean the students were not starting from scratch.
SP1	They had progression...
SP3	And also important we gave all of them this booklet of last year so they worked from the perspective, the dimension they were supposed to investigate on this...
SP1	Okay, that’s interesting.
SP3	Yes.
SP1	So there you connect the different years then, okay.
SP3	Exactly.  "
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Organization of the week,And we need to adapt each year to first of all of our outcomes but also of... We need to adapt to the student because each year we do have different team.
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"the first is that the students become kind of specialists of one of the proposed schemes and then in the second part as every specialist they worked together with the other students to make, develop a project.  So the first... Last year we did about two days a kind of formational apprenticeship of what, for the different themes, we had in the ENAC Week and about three days were kept to work together.  "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"The first morning they had to talk about their speciality that they had to bring into the project and then in the afternoon they formed already the groups for the second part of the project, and then they started from this point on the second day, in the morning, they started to discuss the matter and to decide what they want to do."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"What we tried to do, we had some co-ordination meetings before the Week, but not everyone was here.  "
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"Yes perhaps, but then, so during the Week I was kind of the sergeant, I met with the main managers, I told the students when they had to go there and there as kind of, as conductor of the [inaudible]."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"They were training the specialists, so they’re civil engineers, so they more made observations about how to calculate and how to construct structures, and others they had more about how people can live, as the project was set in India, so how people will live there and how was the urban aspects, so they trained some of the students on these aspects."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"a few lectures but very few as we want to spend a lot of time on the site.  And then we had short presentations and after the first phase they had to present their work [inaudible], so at the end we had another two hours after the Week, so they had to present what they did do in the Week and we gave them feedback on this."
Peter Zurbrugg (E12),Organization of the week,"Well the first was we had co-ordination meetings, this was for preparation, we had a few of them and exchanges of e-mails and so on.  And we had, for the first, as one Week is very short, so we had the Week before and Monday, Tuesday, we used these to get together with all of the fixed groups and to start working before the Week and with the know-how already of what they had to do and so they can get some information from the internet and some other places.  So we were really, how can I say this, we were running already, otherwise it takes one or two days to be efficient.  The first day was kind of the special, making specialists or project specialists and the second day was about making the project, being in the classroom, and the third day this was working on the site.  But then we had one Tuesday, after the Week, we had two hours to organise what would they create as an presentation, as a document, and the second Tuesday, after the Week, it was the presentation itself."
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week,I think since the main requirement was that it’s interdisciplinary and involves the different disciplines the first really demanding task that I had solve was to get the team together.
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week,"So basically I think the first setup of the main idea and what we should do in this ENAC that was my task and then with Hendrik he was helping in developing the experimental parts, in particular the, had always ideas about what we can actually do with logging temperatures inside models.  
	We also had an early architect that was quite important, that was Wim van der Hoede, who was in the first two ENACs there on the architecture side.  He was also helping a lot with trying to see, you know, that they can actually build their little models and all the idea about wind tunnel testing and so that these were locally developed at SLF.  
	And so it was also an interactive process, we then thought it would be good to involve the local energy company so we, since I already knew the CEO there so I asked him if he would come and give a lecture.  And so I think we had a few meetings initially with the group at the time and this is where the concept evolved"
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week,"Alright, and then this question three, who was the main driver in organisation, well...?
SP2	I think initially it was really me, and then I tried to get everything together and then as we worked out the details, so Hendrik has come in as I said, with more the experimental parts and also with the organisational parts because he’s really good at that."
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week,"As I said before, the one important aspect was that we had a couple of brainstorming meetings with the teaching team, the early teaching team, and try to think through what could actually happen there."
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week,So the Week itself has basically three phases which are clearly standout.  So we have an introductory day or introductory phase one where we have an excursion
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week,"they also get a talk by the CEO of the local energy company.  In addition to that then there’s lecturing, giving them the more basics in... An important aspect is to have also the, I didn’t mention him yet, is the Spanish, Joseppe, architect, who is specialised in renewable and environmentally friendly buildings in an Alpine environment.  So he gives his lecture and shows his projects, Hendrik gives some basics on the physics of energy transfer and radiation.  And then we have architectural inputs and so this all gives them a first start-up which is finished in day one, day two, depending on how much we can do beforehand the changes from UTL a little bit.  
	And then in phase two is basically the students will develop then their own concepts with critique from us teachers, so we try to be very present in this phase to try to give them immediate feedback if they go in the wrong, in a direction which will not work very well for them.  But let them develop their concept with the, with a real task that every discipline is represented in the project, so the project should have an energy related part, a physics related part, an environmental related part, an economic part and an architectural part.  And so that’s a requirement and we also judge the initial ideas that they come up with, with respect, and then try to correct where it’s necessary. 
	And then phase two is basically the development of their own concepts and already working out various calculations and trying to put a frame on it, structure their own project.  And then phase three is the main work part where they do either theoretically or work on data or they... In addition every project must have an experimental part, so they need to measure something, put their hands on something, either on a model and measure in a cold lab how the temperature decreases with a certain amount of heating or measure some radiation input as in a snowy environment, in a non-snowy environment, look at the differences and do things like that. "
Michael Lehning (E11),Organization of the week," then there is phase four which is probably a separate phase where they really work on their report, it goes hand-in-hand with phase three, but then also after the week itself usually they are not finished with their report, so they don’t have more time as they move back to Lausanne, and in Lausanne, to finish their reports."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Organization of the week," And so how did you, well, organise or prepare yourself for this week?
SP2	Yes, so I designed my personal contribution to try to balancing theoretical content to where the then practical…
SP1	Application.
SP2	Application, exactly, of the concept. So giving lectures first and then guiding and supervising the students in the practical application of these concepts there. 
So I actually also contributed, since I got involved the last year, proposing this new themes for this Semaine ENAC, of the design of the micro and temporary architecture. That was quite successful because the students found it very, yes, creative, something that you can once in a while go out of the box and invent something and try to, yes, like sort of exaggerate, but in good terms during this week. So also having some fun.
And for the rest the week is organised… Well, so some lectures… So there are four different teachers with four different lectures that teach different topics from environmental to economics and architecture, energy. Different aspects. And then we have the complementary supervision of these four teachers while guiding the students in developing their project."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Organization of the week," it’s trying to balancing theory and practical application of concept mainly. And so the way I proceed was to give a base of theoretical content at the beginning usually, so this is done normally one week before the real intense week in Davos. And in parallel there is also, I think this is very important, to give, to show case studies. So I think it’s important for the students to have reference of something that has been done in a sense, and that they can draw inspiration from.
	And then there is a first phase that is based on observation and discussion, but I would say limited discussion during the first brainstorming of the students among, in their groups. So I’m for giving some freedom in the students to really come up with their idea without influencing them too much, but still try to guide them and, yes, arise some discussion on their concept definition.
	Then there is a third phase of detailed supervision. So then you really can give some technical suggestions and guidance. 
	And then there is also the experimental part, so they try to complement what they’re theoretically developing with some practical application. And as teachers we also try to accept their experiments and to guide them and to suggest some methodologies to optimise them.
	And then the final support in the finalisation of the project. 
	So these are, I think, the five points of the teaching structure along the week."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Organization of the week,"So I just knew that I had to do projects, that there were a few lectures, and then the project were about doing something together between civil, environmental and architecture. So it was not really a detailed project because it was developed in a week, or [inaudible] even, in three days. It was extreme, I think. But, yes, I didn’t know much actually, I just know that it was about a project and about sustainability and building.
SP1	And did you know how, who was in charge and who has which roles or something like that?
SP2	Yes. In Semaine ENAC, yes, I had, I knew that the Mishy [?] was the head of the Semaine ENAC because he was mainly in Davos, so he knew all the facilities in there, he’s responsible for what the students do also there, if there is something that doesn’t go well, it’s his responsibility.
	And then there is Hendrik [?], who is the core, I don’t know, supervisor of the whole group. And then for external issues are Phillipe [?] for, have been there since the beginning I think.
	And then there are, yes, the PhD students I’d say. So, before there was Parag, who was my supervisor, I mentioned you before. And then me and then Luisa, she started with me, and then this year for the first time, we had Riana [?] from Freiburg."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Organization of the week,"And how did you, well, organise or prepare yourself for this ENAC week?
SP2	So I had… I received two years ago the presentation of Parag, the previous PhD student, and then I integrated a little bit with my knowledge and also with what Luisa wanted to do, because we introduced for the first time the concept of temporary architecture. So we wanted to also teach the students something related to that. 
So I’m much more focused on energy and building, so building physics in general, and I think this is the first time for the students to know this topic. So it’s really… Okay, it’s a lecture of one hour and it should be taught for a year probably. So it’s just giving some hints about the building physics, but…
So I prepared a lecture and also the… I always go in the library and look at the books that could be used for the students. I took some books with me about construction also in wood because this temporary architecture has some details in wood and this is not my topic, I always like to have something to help me.
So this is how I prepare, presentation and books in general."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Organization of the week,"Well, for the experimentation it’s mainly Hendrik who is involved in that, so I’m just there to help in case they need something, but I’m not the first one involved in that. So I didn’t really prepare something, it was a…
	May… I just thought about some ideas to give to the students, but not much. Or we also had a brainstorm with Luisa, that’s always useful. But we are in the same office, so we were just discussing informally, so…"
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Organization of the week,"Well, mainly for me, I have to admit the first year I had the same age of the students, so now I’m, yes, I’m becoming a little bit older, I’d say, but, yes, from a social point of view I think that see Mishy and Hendrik and Joseph [?] and Phillipe as the main tutor, and then we are just there to help.
	But I like it, I think that they see really us at the kind of the same level. Of course we’re not, we’re a little bit more, hopefully. But we are not superimposing our knowledge."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Organization of the week,"So this year they had less time for the project because they had longer lectures. So finally they had three days and the last… So the first day there is a tour of Davos just to know also where they could put their architecture or their project, this is also very important.  And also to know already what is there from a energy point of view for energy production. And then we had the lectures and then the project.
And finally we had the… After one week they had one day to, again, to show us what they produced. And then they had a presentation, five, ten minutes each, and then yesterday they had the plan on with the other Semaine ENAC.  
So in general I think it’s a good structure. Of course, I preferred last year but this year we could have the possibility to do differently, so it’s okay."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Organization of the week,"it’s clearly Hendrik that is the driver, the glue between the… In the team, yes, but, I mean, the iteration is very collegial thing.  It’s all together but the glue inbetween, the linking between everybody is really, it’s clearly Hendrik."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Organization of the week,"Like, the questions were really, like, task-oriented, so the… All this one-to-one, the iteration between student, professor.  We let them work, we go to them to go, okay, how does it work?  Just showing that we are there.  How does it go?  Do you have everything right?  And they are, oh, we have that, we have that.  And they know, like, they know Giorgia is, like, a specialist for the solar thing, so when it’s Giorgia that comes around and says, okay, they ask questions about solar.  If it’s me, it’s about economic stuff like that.  When it’s Hendrik, it’s how are our experiments? Stuff.  So it’s really… They know how to use us and it’s really a… Well, I mean, it’s… I don’t know how would classify the didactic approach but it’s really trial and error and learning by doing."
Philippe Belanger (E13),Organization of the week,"I mean, the secret of the success, I think, is a lot about the team that we manage to have.  Me, Hendrik, Josep, Michy all together with Parag at the beginning, which has been replaced by Luisa and Giorgia.  Which took the huge shoes that Parag left and filled them really nice.  Luisa and Giorgia arrived with the idea of temporary design, that was their contribution at the beginning, and I really think that they are able to bring it at the new… At a nice level.  So the fact that they are talking about leaving next year, it’s kind of, okay… It’s not as I’ve used that… Will have the same chemistry with the newcomers because that’s a huge part. "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Organization of the week,"So that was yes, I would say quite a democratic process although I would say maybe for and still until today Mihi and I we have a bit a lead in terms of organisation, in terms of formulating topics.  And then we have some senior members that are there since a couple of years and some other that are fairly new and hopefully they stay for a few years and that we don’t have to have an exchange every year.  I think it’s also important that if you engage for Semaine ENAC that you do it at least a few years.  To see an evolution at the first year is probably you just learn how to do it and then second year you can be more productive.  "
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Organization of the week,"So normally we have the preparatory classes, they... Typically they are three, three hours and in these three hours we give an introduction like a global introduction of what the Semaine ENAC will be about.  This is after they have selected the Semaine ENAC because there is normally in December all the ENAC weeks are presented to all the students and then they make their choice and they get signed up.  And then they come in our Semaine ENAC and we do a kind of introduction to explain them what we are going to do, what is expected from them also.  And then we typically start to give them a common background that means a couple of lectures, well these are lectures but we try to keep them as interactive as possible.  That they can always ask their questions that it could even turn into a discussion while we still manage to give them all the information they need.  But it’s not a classical ex cathedra [?] to some extent yes because you know they are diverse and so we have to create a common base and then we go from there.  
So that is the preparation and there is a lot of logistics in our case that has to be communicated.  Like because we are not on campus, like where to go, what to bring and so on.  This is... Should not be underestimated, I am typically taking care of all that, I have to say I’m taking care of a big part in terms of the preparation.  Because simply because Mihi has a lower presence here but so I do the presentation in December, I do usually most of the lectures and if somebody other... Somebody else is lecturing I am present.  I do most of the logistics in terms of reservations, get the tickets and inform them.  Set up the Moodle site which is also another key word."
Hendrik Huwald (E7),Organization of the week,"then there is of course the local organisation which is mainly Mihi’s part whatever is necessary in Davos like reserving seminar rooms, maybe the infrastructure, see that the labs, the workshop is available.  That that’s his preparatory part."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Organization of the week,"Fred was also taking part.  There were also two of my colleagues from the architecture department.  And then, we had interventions from people in the concrete lab, and also in the steel lab on the [inaudible].  So those were more like, you know, one-hour interventions.  
We also had an intervention on glass as a structural kind of element.  Someone at [inaudible] was doing testing with the structural glass. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Organization of the week," in terms of kind of teaching, I guess, you know, it was the three of us from ALIS, which is one of the architectural laboratories.  And then, Fred from EBAW [?], who was also kind of, you know, helped us to organise the spaces that we worked in, which was actually very important to have that space."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Organization of the week," Fred took it over this year.  And you know, he was kind of responsible for doing the organisational things.  And I think, you know, maybe there was some discussion at the end of last year over how much the students got from those, also.  And I left it up to him really, to make the contacts again, and structure the week as he saw fit.  So I think, you know, he decided maybe that we would not have those this year."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Organization of the week,"Celine was there doing the juries.  So she, whenever we had at three points during the week we had a kind of testing, you know, a testing session.  So she was there as a critic during those testing sessions."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Organization of the week,"SP1	But the concept, so the basic ideas come from you?  Or was it also in conversation with the other guys? 
SP2	Definitely last year, it was in conversation certainly with my colleagues in ALIS.  We kind of, when we wrote the proposal we thought about the lectures quite a bit. "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Organization of the week,"the week was structured in terms of these testing sessions.  And you know, as you know it’s very few days.  And I think it’s also structured on the material limitations that they have to work with, in the sense that they first day they’re, you know, working with wood that they find in the forest.  
You know, the second one they’re working with wood members that they’re just being introduced to, so something which is a totally new material.  And the third time they do the project, they’re working with material that’s a little bit more familiar to them, in that they’ve already done it once.  So you know, in that sense, these three sessions structure the hands on element.  
And I would say that the lectures, the two lectures that we did are, you know, come at the early part of the week to maybe put them in a mind-set that makes them a little critical of reflective of how they’re working.  So that they can not only do things and work together, but also maybe be in mind-set to kind of think about how they’re doing things, and think about how they’re working together."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week," I, basically, was more or less delegated: okay, you are responsible for this part, you are responsible for this part, etc"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week,"I think this is, of course, not up to me, yes, to…  I mean, I suggest it, but then if this person who is in charge of the programme doesn’t want to take it up, then it’s his decision, yes"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week,"you do this in three consecutive years, but then there are always other students.  So then, in one year, you know, you bring the students; in one week they achieve a certain knowledge; the next year you have new students, so they have to start from zero again.  But then they have to speed up because they have to get further the next week.  So then you cannot go into the detail so much any more, because then they have to really start constructing something."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week,"how do you provide the knowledge from the last years for the next year’s students?
SP2	So there is a...  In our case, there was a booklet that was produced, so they were supposed to read it, but, of course, you know…
SP1	Before the Week?
SP2	Yes.  But many of the students didn’t have a look at it."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week," the structure was basically to provide them with this basic knowledge very quickly on the first day.  Then they already, you know, the…  This was basically the formation of the specialists, and then they made bigger groups where they had people from different disciplines, and they started then to work on the real project.  And from Day Three on they actually did real work onsite on these containers; they started to construct these containers"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week," And then the specialists, they were distributed into different groups, and there they would help the architects and the civil engineers to solve the water problems."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week,"we already prepared some water treatment systems, because this would not have been possible that they start from scratch.  So, of course, there was already some material that was prepared and then it was not completely open in what direction it would go."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Organization of the week,"the water part was a little bit detached from the construction and the architectural part.  And I think the students certainly saw, you know, how the architects work and how the civil engineers work in the construction, and I think this was very instructive.  But I think it was more or less, you know, each discipline would do their job and the others would just get an impression, you know, how this works."
Tom Battin (E16),Organization of the week,"sure, so there were… I mean, like, that got structured then, before that, so who’s going to give a presentation on what, etc., etc.  So that was clearly structured also, like, the involvement of both, like, [inaudible] from the head in Geneva, and [inaudible].  So that was structured indeed.  And then, what we did of course, is the way, you know, based on this transversal measure, like again, production, construction, and what was it again, I don’t remember.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Organization of the week,"Exploitation, so based on this, and based on the two, like, ecosystems, if you want or habitats like the [non-English] and [non-English].  So we decided to have six groups, you know, which gives the basic structure to that [inaudible].  And then, the idea was also, so that we had six groups.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Organization of the week,"Three of these, like, meetings with the students, and so where we kind of guided them, etc., etc.  And that was more, like, open again, like, at least during the beginning.  At the beginning, when the students, when they kind of presented what they’ve been doing that far, what they’d done that far.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Organization of the week,"I think three or four, depending on the presence or absence of the teachers, you know, kind of was with each group.  And this changed that.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Organization of the week,"Exactly, and at the beginning I was a little bit critical at that.  And then, I realised that was a really good idea because also for the students.  Because on Day A, they were confronted to do teaching, Group Teachers A.  And then, during Day B, to the others, so that was a good…"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"So we rapidly found a professor that was willing accept the idea to come with students, to [unclear], who had to miss class for one week, so was not completely officialised. Although it was official because of the [unclear], they had authorisation from the direction of the school, "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"And what I’ve done, it’s proposed bit of money to Savalle Gelpas, outside of the presents, of the change [unclear] during the week. So we made a deal about, I think, 3000 SFr. So like 2000 SFr [?] for the week and 1000 SFr for the proprietary work. Savalle Gelpas was interested to develop that project because it was in relation with his more polar artistic project. But it was necessary to pay someone, that was also because he has lots of collection in Valais. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"And so because we were to organise a roundtable, we had to organise a place to sleep and stuff like that, and what I’ve done when it was in Brussels, I’m co-directing a, co-supervising a PhD [unclear] in Brussel. And I paid like €2000 for two years, you know she will get, find the seminary [?] rooms at the university, find the people for the roundtable, the two roundtables in Brussels. So outside of our own assistant, because they also play an important role, but to have someone who was really involved, connected with the place we are going, and those people, they were always, [unclear], they were paid."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"And then for the administrative [?] questions, and because they are quite heavy, especially when you move away, and the question of taking on a ticket to go together. Finally we did not do it, but then that was also a problem because the students thought it was too expensive to buy their own ticket, plus to pay someone the money. And, but for the administrative, although the administrative duties, we have the two assistants, which are Michelle Pirot [?] and Tobias [?] [unclear] were PhD students from myself, and it’s part of the… We attribute to PhD students a class for each semester. So they were linked to that class for the spring semester. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"And so there is [unclear], paid person that was two assistant. And then we have a couple of meetings with the rest of the team, also with the assistant and everything, and Savalle Gelpas, to start thinking of the programme week and the content of the teaching. So I, you know, started where Savalle and I, we started by reading a couple of questions and then setting the first presentation of the week, because we have to, especially we have to do it quite early because it has to be in the programme. So in a certain way we have to present week before having opportunities to discuss with the rest of the teaching team. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week," they join for the meeting, we discuss together and, but quite [unclear]. There were two mains tasks actually, well three maybe. It’s, we had, from the beginning we had the idea of working with groups and so we have to find a way to decompose the research and to have something for each group. So we came up with the idea of working with the piece [?] and [unclear]"
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"that each group has… We wanted to come up [?] quite early with the, with a very small amount of choices for the students, because otherwise they were a bit more free in Brussels. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"before the week started we had to discuss the incorporation, [unclear] of the art student, and art questions also, because that was… But for that, yes, we had… Actually Savalle was doing the mediation. We did not have that much meetings with the professor from the art school. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Organization of the week,"There’s always an experimental dimension of the week, and that was probably part of the.. Seeing that, then students could decide it because they [unclear] so well organised and… But we knew already from other weeks that we have to try to really, from the beginning, to really make clear what they have to turn in, or to"
Derek Christie (E3),Organization of the week,"Tebo Homanie was there, but just to give a few indications about maps and some freeware that people could make maps with. "
Derek Christie (E3),Organization of the week,"There’s a clear organisation pattern because, as always, Dominque is the one who’s, kind of, in charge.  She’s the one who’s sending the emails around.  She’s the one who’s creating the tables with: this is what we’re doing on Monday; this is what we’re doing on Tuesday; this is what hasn’t been resolved.  This what you have to look at.  So I have to look at and... She was really doing that part. "
Derek Christie (E3),Organization of the week,"we had one group each, basically, were each responsible for one group.  So I knew I had to write up a little document on my group, or for my group, which I did.  So it’s a combination of organisation and flexibility, which I think is... I wouldn't say it’s ideal, but it’s getting there.  I mean, it’s pretty good; like, when you have a really small organisation, it’s possible to work that way.  We’re all on the same floor and we, sort of, bump into each other.  It’s, kind of, informal, but we did have a... maybe three or four actual meetings where we sat down for an hour or so, to discuss things.  And other moments where it was more informal."
Derek Christie (E3),Organization of the week,"I think most of them were not involved at all in the organisation of the week.  There’s a historic reason – I don't know if we’re going to talk about it later – why there are people from the outside.  I think there’s an historic element to that.  There was one person from the outside, called, Bettina Shadfly [?], who is, more or less, part of the core team, although, this year she was not very available.  It didn’t look, actually, that she was part of the core team, but she was.  I missed the first day because I was in a conference abroad.  But, otherwise, the people who intervened...  who came to say...  to give talks on something, were basically from the outside.  They were not involved in the organisation."
Derek Christie (E3),Organization of the week,"pretty clear difference between the people in the core team and the people who are brought in as outside experts.  And on obvious difference is: the internal people are not paid, and we have a budget to pay for the external people, yes."
Derek Christie (E3),Organization of the week,"ust to fill in what I was saying before – there was... there are two people from an NGO called Idigio [?], and they had an intermediate position between the core team and the invited experts from the outside.  They were officially outside experts from the outside, but they were... there were several initial meetings before, in order to coordinate with us. "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Organization of the week, joint organisation of the other organisers
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Organization of the week,"driver is Dominique [?], so the person who is really most in charge of it"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Organization of the week,I was really just someone who was like an external researcher 
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Organization of the week,But I was definitely not involved in the organisation.
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Organization of the week,"idea came largely from the people, the sort of external… What was it, a consultancy company, I think"
Lutringer and Graezer Bideau (E10),Position of the week in institutional context,And from the EIJS our institute we are the only one teaching.  
Michael Lehning (E11),Position of the week in institutional context,"how is the ENAC week positioned in the syllabus of your school, like the curriculum?
SP2	I think it’s an important part of the Bachelor curriculum, so it’s important for the students, but it’s also important for us because it is the first contact with the students and a quite close contact, so they get to see us in an environment that is much more relaxed and if they have to deal with my radiation transfer modelling in the atmosphere which makes them a little bit tight sometimes, and so I think it’s good, it’s good for both sides, yes I’m a real supporter of that idea."
Michael Lehning (E11),Position of the week in institutional context,"I think it should not be optional, so I think it’s a very important experience that they have early in their studies and it’s also good to break out these inter-disciplinary boundaries in the curriculum so that they already know okay there is also architects out there and the architects will have a say on the project, it’s not the engineers that drive it or the other way around."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Position of the week in institutional context,"And what do you think, is it kind of equal to the other teaching tasks here, or teaching, well, offerings you have? Or is it kind of special, additional, or something like that?
SP2	I think in terms of skills improvement, it can be absolutely comparable to any other teaching…
SP1	No, it’s meant more like the organisational thing, is it kind of a normal teaching offer you have? Like a normal course but just in a week? Or is it kind of really add-on, apart from your institute, it’s really…?
SP2	No. It’s part of the curriculum, yes. So… I think so. I mean I think it’s…
SP1	No, just for you personally, it’s not… It’s kind of normal teaching work here?
SP2	Yes. Yes I think it’s comparable to other, yes, teaching courses."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Position of the week in institutional context,"So I think it’s becoming more and more important in general, the projeter ensemble, because the interdisciplinary is, yes, it’s something that it’s having more and more importance in ENAC, I think, in general. So also the Semaine ENAC is getting more and more important. 
Before maybe it was just a try, and then they understood that it was important also for students, also by looking at their feedback, so they are really happy to collaborate for the first time and merge with the others which is something that doesn’t happen in the other universities. So it never happened to me, for example, and I wish I could had a similar experience, actually. Yes, so I think it’s becoming more and more important but actually I don’t know, from unofficial point of view, this is just something I think."
Giorgia Chinazzo (E6),Position of the week in institutional context,"So I find it challenging for them, but also really… It’s… I think it’s the first time especially for a civil and environmental engineer that they need to, that they face a project, I think, together in a group. Of course, architects are much more into that, but for them it’s the first time that they have a short time and with, they’re working with a group, with other people, with other, yes, expert, let’s say."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Position of the week in institutional context,I think I kind of shared the sensation that it’s not so well recognised. 
Derek Christie (E3),Position of the week in institutional context,"I'm sorry to say I don't know the syllabus of the school, even less for the three year tendencies, you know: architecture, civil engineering, and environment.  I don't know.  I've a feeling the integration is not complete yet, and if... if we are serious about trans-disciplinarity [?], then, I think a good step would be to improve the integration, because this week is a vector for all... for trans-disciplinarity.  So if there was some way of embedding it a bit more in the school year, I think it would be good.  I've no idea how, because I don't know what the... I imagine you can't just move things around very easily, but I there was some kind of continuity; if there was a bit more time, it might help."
Derek Christie (E3),Position of the week in institutional context,"sorry, the students are keen to get on with doing whatever... whatever else they have to do.  And there’s something... there’s a law exam or something like that, which is somehow attached to this."
Derek Christie (E3),Position of the week in institutional context,"I don't understand that, but it’s something that... "
Derek Christie (E3),Position of the week in institutional context,"they're priority is to pass their second year.  I mean, it’s so vitally important, that whatever, you know... we’re giving them this extra stuff to do and they're happy, but that’s not the main thing they have to do.  Yes... "
Derek Christie (E3),Position of the week in institutional context," But would it make more sense in the third year, or is completely impossible?  I don't know.  I don't know, but I... I’d have a completely open mind about it. "
Derek Christie (E3),Position of the week in institutional context," I think the ENAC week does respond to a need and, perhaps, can be partitioned or positioned, or expanded in different ways... yes.  I feel there’s something slightly missing.  "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Position of the week in institutional context,"es, it would be very hard to say, to reassign the Week in a way when they have more background. It would mean to have it at the end of the studies, which was never the idea. Things that are… It’s not really clear whether they’re… Are they’re doing it the Week they’re supposed to learn how to make presentations, for example, or are they supposed to know that already? "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Position of the week in institutional context,"es, so part of the time of the Week ENAC is maybe also really just lost, because you have to teach them some basic competencies and working together and coming up with presentations. "
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Position of the week in institutional context,"es, they see what they need to learn later on, so they get a feeling for what is missing, what they know already. So… Yes. Now I’m… I think it’s well-positioned, but as I… I still think that it’s obviously not ideal to have this single week…"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Position of the week in institutional context,"That cuts the whole semester, that takes away classes from other important topics, and which, in the end, is quite short."
Luisa Pastore (E9),Recommendations,"I think it’s something right that we discuss with Marilyne about it is that it should be… I mean, as a teacher, one should be involved in the Semaine ENAC for at least, let’s say two years, so that you can really get the most of it and have a fresh experience. Learn from this and really be able to apply a second time and the lesson learned from the first, and really improve yourself in that. So I think this is a very interesting reasoning we made recently. So I think there will be a sort of, a change of teaching inside our lab for the contribution we give to Semaine ENAC which is fair enough, I think."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Recommendations," one thing that we could do next year is to have them film their own testing sessions.  Because I think that actually could be a useful tool that they document themselves, that aspect."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Recommendations," I think what I think we could do better, for me, would be a way to strengthen it would be really to – it’s maybe some of the things we’ve talked about already.  But I think it’s finding that balance, or finding that, you know, figuring out how to integrate a more kind of theoretical component into the work, in a way that kind of, you know, points them in the right directions, I guess.  "
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Recommendations,"because I teach mostly studio courses, and because my kind of capacities, in terms of structural engineering, or civil engineering, or environmental engineering, it’s very, for me, those disciplines are also very kind of exotic.  I wouldn’t even know how to teach them in a sense.  
And if we could find someone, I think the thing that would be great is if we could find someone in the civil engineering department, or in environmental engineering who could be somehow an equal partner actually."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Recommendations,"You know, but I guess that would really be a big help, you know, having someone from one of those schools or both of those schools who was as equally engaged in the work, and could help us kind of, you know, shape things in a way that could be, you know, a little bit more give and take, I guess, between the schools, yes."
Sony Devabhaktuni (E15),Recommendations,"really maybe understanding kind of pedagogically what it means to engage with the students from three different schools in three different disciplines because especially within architecture, the teaching, how you teach is so specific.  At least, it seems to me that it is.  
And the engineering students always say that.  They always say, you know, we never have classes like this.  So for us it was fun, you know?  So I don’t, yes, I think that having some guidance on pedagogically what it means to kind of bring these three different disciplines together."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,"we have finished the second year, so we should meet as quickly as possible, yes, to sort of discuss a little bit what went well, what didn’t go so well, and then already think about next year, what we would like to do next year."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations," I like to sort of look at things when they’re still fresh and then already, you know, prepare something; then in a year from now we can just take this out of the drawer and we don’t have to think, okay, what did we do last time and…?"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,"I think it would be nicer to have the same students, you know, continue and then have also the final product."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,"they started to build some walls, and...  But, you know, they’re beginners and then already after the Semaine ENAC, over the weekend these walls, some of the walls collapsed, yes.  So I think, you know, in terms of the actual construction, they would also need more instructions.  I mean, the…  So they probably would need some person from a real construction company come here…"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations," this would also be better if you would have the same students three times, then they would already know, okay, this year I expect this or that.  And then they could also maybe get prepared a little bit better."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,"so I think it would be good to maybe have, you know, before ENAC Week starts, that they would have one day like a workshop where they learn how to do things; how to do woodwork and maybe some, you know, to build a wall with cement and things like that.  I think that would be very useful, yes, that they would have like a small practical course on this, so then when they start constructing it, that they don’t do things wrong.  Because there’s really not much time in the Semaine ENAC if you have to do something concrete, yes.  If you do it theoretically it’s okay"
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,crucial skill is that you have to be a good organiser!
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,"You have to also have sufficient time to do it, so I think it would be good if you have like an assistant to help you organise it.  And I think you have to find a good topic to do it, where actually the different disciplines can work together."
Urs von Gunten (E17),Recommendations,"you should be willing to really invest some time into it, yes, that’s…  I mean, that’s not really a skill, but I think one should not underestimate the time that it takes to organise such an ENAC Week.  And, also, the sort of the networking I think is also quite important, yes."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"is they were not prepared enough to work in an interdisciplinary, or a multi-disciplinary setting.  So they were not prepared to do so, right?  And that was also part of the critiques that we got back from the students.  But that’s relatively easy to fix for next year. "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"Unfortunately, this must be outside.  This must happen before because Semaine ENAC is really short.  It’s extremely short, and even way too short, right?  And we all know that, like, interdisciplinary work, it takes a while, you know? "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations," If we want to keep that one, then that one must be a priority training towards interdisciplinary work.  Otherwise, I don’t think it will work fine.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"I think it would be an extremely most welcome added value.  But again, it needs some precursor work.  That’s very important, you know?  So now we know, we think that in ENAC we want to have interdisciplinary work, which is not easy at all I think, right? "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"And that’s like, the basic structure that I would definitely maintain.  There may be ways to optimise this.  For instance, again, you know, feed them with information.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"So it’s a warming up phase, or ramping up phase.  So that’s really something that I would like to see implemented.  That would then facilitate the actual work during the Semaine ENAC enormously. "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"It’s like, the very close and continuous contact between the students and the teachers.  So that’s also great.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"The fact that they have that opportunity, I think that’s just great.  And that’s also something that I would definitely like to maintain.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"A longer week, for 24 hours a day.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"certainly I think more time.  But also, I think perhaps like, you know, like, topics that are better constrained, that are more focused, that are as clear as possible.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"by having perhaps even smaller groups perhaps, better focused subjects."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"Rather than taking three or four disciplines, having perhaps two, three at max.  And then, coming up with, you know, perhaps, kind of a small project."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"And you know, for an EPFL, I think we should kind of increase the overall level a little bit.  And there a lot of teachers available.  But rather than having, like, eight teachers sitting on one Semaine ENAC, they are splitting this perhaps."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"having smaller groups.  I think that would be fantastic. And at the end, I think if you come up with then a cost benefit calculation, you know?  It would be more efficient, even, I think so. "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"SP2	No, I think so, so really helping, like, cutting this down a little bit.  And then, cutting this down a little bit, I think it would be great.  And therefore, also, I mean, you know, I think it’s important they learn how to present themselves to the public.  How to present their results, but also not only being there, but also with some enthusiasm, Number 1, but also with more concept, with more structure, with etc., etc. on the one hand.  "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"become mandatory that the students that they deliver a written report, oh, absolutely."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"that should also have some reflections on the home page of the whatever, ENAC, or wherever, you know, where this product being made available on the home page, even. "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"So I think because that producing something like this does cost money, having something on the home page costs money, but way less money. "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"to smaller groups, with less disciplines,"
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"Or disciplines, you know that make more sense to work together.  So that the immediate result becomes more visible obvious.  I think that could be a good, like, incentive for both teachers, professors to take part, but also for students."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"he chance is higher to get something valuable, a valuable piece out of this, than with the larger group."
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"nd with that, cutting it down to smaller ones, etc., etc., may be help. "
Tom Battin (E16),Recommendations,"upstream, and better downstream set of activities to prepare the students to this.  And after that to better present, convey that, yes.  "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Recommendations,"On the contrary, I think it’s quite exciting, but it’s quite demanding. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Recommendations,"Then it’s my knowledge and my experience, and actually the experience of some of my colleagues who have done a couple of them, or we always have been away. And so it’s, going away, it’s more demanding. It’s more demanding to, for administrative reasons, and for the assistant. So it’s quite a demanding job, so you have to be attentive to that. There’s a way to use some of the money to pay someone to help out with that, but also to have an assistant which are well involved in the project. Then it’s quite important to really try to integrate it into the work team [?]."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Recommendations,"very attentive to the way, the schedule of the week, and especially because normally in each of these ENAC week there’s experimental field work dimension. [Unclear] although that’s, yes, it has to start as soon as possible, for the students to gather data and to really get into it so they don’t have this panic dimension. And be really clear from the beginning, to what we expect from the."
Luca Patteroni (E8),Recommendations,"you understand the problem is, when you start a new ENAC week, it’s difficult to really foresee what you can expect, and also you want to maybe… Yes, there’s part of research element or an exploratory element, and so you have to be aware that there will always be some adjustment. But yes, it’s, we try to find a balance between re-ensuing [?] elements and exploratory elements. Yes. "
Luca Patteroni (E8),Recommendations,I’d probably have to look at statistics on the composition of the teams. 
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"some students, you definitely can give them the keys.  And sometimes not.  And if they're groups, well there always might be one or two guys who are just hanging on and everybody else... the other guys are doing the work and so on."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations," if you're going to start from scratch, I think you definitely need a team within EPFL.  You need several people on the outside that you can pay and who are reliable.  And you've got to expect that the first year is going to be tough, probably rough riding for everyone – unfortunately.  But, I think there are risks, because we’re asking so much of... there’s so much student participation.  There’s quite a big degree of freedom, so... I mean, it can be great but it’s... I think whoever’s going to start, has to think about: I'm going to do this for two or three years with such and such a group.  This sort of budget; these sorts of people from the outside; possibly and NGO, like we had.  Not people who are going to be here today, gone tomorrow.  Because I think if you just try it for one year and it doesn’t work, you would be tempted to give up."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,some continuity to... to prove..
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"it’s very important to feel encouraged by the faculty and the presidency, the vice presidency of the EPFL.  It’s very important to feel that encouragement.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"no plenary session, and I... I know a lot of people were disappointed.  I didn’t know what it was, so I wasn’t that disappointed, but this year, when we had it, I thought it was really great.  It’s really important, even if it’s only two or three minutes per week, to be able to go in front of everyone and say what it’s about.  I think that’s really important.  I wish there was some way of getting more students to come and avoid them, you know, just talking to each other while the thing is going on, but, it’s a good start.  But I'm thinking that if it was possible to have a really... something perhaps slightly more formal, I don't know... but to have a real, not a party, but almost, something quite formal, that you say, well, this is what happened.  I think it’s... what happened this year is very good: it would be something very similar to that, but somehow a little bit... a little bit stronger and, hopefully, with a bit more interest from the students – I hope."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,bit more exchanges across the... across the weeks and..
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"That’s... that would be a great idea, but I don't know how to do it, and it would take a lot of time.  And, our students told us that they thought it was great working on this, but they had exams and things that they had to give in: projects and so on. "
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"Like, for example, I’m just thinking... we had one week and we had a whole day where we went somewhere else.  So I was thinking: if that day could be at some other point, maybe we would actually have a full week to work on it."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"Maybe an additional day would help, but I think people who have more experience with this will, perhaps, give you more precise opinion.  I... I just have the feeling it’s a little bit tight."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"I think it is valued: we do get support.  I think it’s not valued enough: we don't get enough support, but there is some.  I think it would be necessary to improve the visibility of the ENAC week somehow.  And I don't know if it should be an ENAC week or if it should be something, as we said before, a bit more spread out.  Which... perhaps not over the whole year, but maybe one semester or half a semester, I don't know.  Maybe some thought has to be given to what format it should have, because I think the format does have an effect on how it’s viewed and valued by the students, the teachers and everybody else."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"I'm not really sure if it’s something which should be kept in its present form or something which should be developed into something different.  I’d be open to both.  Already now, if you think about it, you have one or two lessons before, and then one or two lessons afterwards.  So, there already is something a little bit wider, except that that interferes with the other things they're doing."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"how do you free up the space, and how much space does the EPFL want to free up for it.  And perhaps, finally, I find them a bit young.  I think it’s great for them to do it at this sort of age, but it’s clearly the sort of approach which is much easier to do with Master’s students, because the Master’s students already come, usually, from several different backgrounds.  It’s very rare to have them all from the same background."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"And, yes, it’s more difficult when you have Bachelor students, definitely.  So I think it’s... despite all I've said, I’m not sure it’s that easy to improve on it.  I think the format’s quite good: it needs a little bit of tweaking; a little bit of adaptation, perhaps, here and there."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"But would it make more sense in the third year, or is completely impossible?  I don't know.  I don't know, but I... I’d have a completely open mind about it."
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations,"Something which still needs to be done, either, as you said, to glue them together, or have them talking to each other.  So we don't know anything about the other ENAC weeks.  "
Derek Christie (E3),Recommendations," a super structure or some way of coordinating them between each other.  There is something that’s still lacking,"
Bettina Schaefli (E2),Recommendations,"SP2	Well, the one thing I know is that it could certainly… We sometimes have the impression it could profit if the student had more theoretical background, but that’s so specific to the different topics that it’s… Yes, it would be very hard to say, to reassign the Week in a way when they have more background. It would mean to have it at the end of the studies, which was never the idea. Things that are… It’s not really clear whether they’re… Are they’re doing it the Week they’re supposed to learn how to make presentations, for example, or are they supposed to know that already? We came to the conclusion that there are many aspects that you need for project work that are never taught at EPFL and that are just supposed to naturally emerge from the students. It’s the same for the cours ENAC, yes. But there are competencies they’re just supposed to have."
