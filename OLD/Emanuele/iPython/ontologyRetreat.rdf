I mean, the secret of the success, I think, is a lot about the team that we manage to have.  Me, Hendrik, Josep, Michy all together with Parag at the beginning, which has been replaced by Luisa and Giorgia.  Which took the huge shoes that Parag left and filled them really nice.  Luisa and Giorgia arrived with the idea of temporary design, that was their contribution at the beginning, and I really think that they are able to bring it at the new\uFFFD At a nice level.  So the fact that they are talking about leaving next year, it\uFFFDs kind of, okay\uFFFD It\uFFFDs not as I\uFFFDve used that\uFFFD Will have the same chemistry with the newcomers because that\uFFFDs a huge part." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/interview436> <http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/content> "And well so last question for this part which are the key or is the key interdisciplinary aspect of your week?  How would you describe it?\nSP2	We tried to put as much of these aspects in the title of the Semaine ENAC, the title was a little longer, I think a few years ago and then the academic service said you have 140 characters or whatever and we had to reduce.  So I think our original idea was to group the interdisciplinary aspect around two key words.  One is renewable energy and this is really applied to different scales, like from the smallest scale of having a small standalone unit to large scale energy production.  Or energy storage in the landscape.  And the second element is I would say sustainability, again, in a very large sense sustainability with respect to or applied to landscape and a natural environment and to build infrastructure.  And bringing all these together I think we have two elements that give a wealth of questions, interesting and relevant to the students of the three sections.  Because all of them are concerned with energy question, the architects when designing buildings, the civil engineers anyway for maybe power production.  The environmental engineering... Engineers as well for also handling energy, transmission.  \nBut then also citing of infrastructures work and they put these things where we have natural risks and hazards, how does it integrate in the landscape, how does it integrate with valid regulations and law and so on?  And in this context I should also mention that... And that\uFFFDs maybe a bit particular of our Semaine ENAC that we are also covering economic aspects which I think is nice and it\uFFFDs probably for most of them a new element.  They don\uFFFDt have this in class or anything, we have a dedicated specialist or expert for that and I think it\uFFFDs a nice component to bring... To develop a project where you also do at least a basic calculation to see that it\uFFFDs something realistic and maybe viable." .

Well all cases are particular I assume.  I got involved when shortly after Mihi [?] arrived here as a prof and he was kind of building up his teaching activities.  And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from... More the lead on Mihi to get involved in something.  And this seemed to be to me a good opportunity as an interdisciplinary course to learn something about the faculty and something beyond my own field. " .

First of all because I was interested in improving my teaching skills so it was for really personal interest. And I was really excited to work in an interdisciplinary environment because throughout my education\uFFFD So both my master\uFFFDs degree in architectural engineering which is already kind of hybrid and interdisciplinary by definition, and then a PhD as an engineer, got in the Department of Architecture, carrying out a thesis which focused on environmental design, was already sort of in keeping on working on interdisciplinarity in my studies. \nAnd so I became more and more aware of the importance of interdisciplinarity today, which in the field of construction and building environment in general is definitely essential. So both at the research and professional level, and started to be considered also as an essential framework for the teaching practice.\nAlso I wanted to give myself this challenge, I found it very interesting, and I also liked a lot the fact of coupling theory and practice, that I thought was very interesting as well. \nAnd also having some fun, so having some regenerative time with the students in a different environment and out of the usual and daily routine standards of academic, yes, routine." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/interview155> <http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/content> "One of the things is that they should practice what they usually apply only in theoretical courses, just as one main issue is really to handle tools and to like make a project but not only, to also calculate it, but also to build it at the end, which is where, for me just, from my experience it was really not so easy for them.  Because they did not even know the names of basic tools, so I think from this point they learnt a lot.  \n	And then the second thing was to have to work together, and they learnt how the architects worked, how civil engineering are thinking and working and some of the other side they had to help them, because architects they can, they do drawings so they draw for civil engineers, and civil engineers help architects to design structures.  So from this point of view it was really an exchange" .

I think the main interest or one of the main interests of the ENAC Week is it\uFFFDs kind of time out, because architecture students especially, but perhaps the others, in Week they switch from course to the other, architects are very often, they\uFFFDre very involved in the architectural projects and so it takes them a lot of time.  If you have one course [inaudible] from other courses in a teaching unit.\n	If you have an afternoon, so they came at one o\uFFFDclock, they work for you and then at four o\uFFFDclock, five o\uFFFDclock they say they\uFFFDve got a lot of things to do.  But the ENAC Week is kind of time out, so all the other things will stop so they can concentrate for four or five days only on one thing, one thing which is very interesting.

It was a seed money on urban incentive and the idea was to work on a project that Alan had once developed with a colleague of him and his own bag about the use of containers.  And how does that context and they apply for F&S grant, they didn\uFFFDt have it.  It was a [inaudible] research and one of the main critic had in the expertise was the luck of social dimension, a cultural dimension of the project.\nSP1	Okay.\nSP2	So that was the very base of the project where Alan proposed to Eva [inaudible] as a people representing a different lab or institute to try to collaborate together and to launch a new project.  Which includes really our EIJS our competencies about cultural and social dimension.  And so we launch this project we won one of the seed money amongst others and on the same line Alan decided to launch also the ENAC week with a high potential because it includes multidisciplinary project. \nSP1	Yes.\nSP2	And so this... All this project plus since 2014 we had some semester project also based globally on the use of containers in different situation and all these different activities actually form actually the core... Basic core of this ENAC.  So all these different project with the help of different teach with also the help of student that did some research, some project help us to organise this project." .

In reality that would last one week, and they do it like in an hour and then after one hour they decide, okay, we go for this decision and then now we need to decide this, this, this, so it\uFFFDs really active, I think.\nAnd they know also that probably the final output won\uFFFDt be their best because they don\uFFFDt have time, but anyway the result they have is the result of a group, of a collaboration, so I find it really nice.

And then we have architectural inputs and so this all gives them a first start-up which is finished in day one, day two, depending on how much we can do beforehand the changes from UTL a little bit.  \n	And then in phase two is basically the students will develop then their own concepts with critique from us teachers, so we try to be very present in this phase to try to give them immediate feedback if they go in the wrong, in a direction which will not work very well for them.  But let them develop their concept with the, with a real task that every discipline is represented in the project, so the project should have an energy related part, a physics related part, an environmental related part, an economic part and an architectural part.  And so that\uFFFDs a requirement and we also judge the initial ideas that they come up with, with respect, and then try to correct where it\uFFFDs necessary. \n	And then phase two is basically the development of their own concepts and already working out various calculations and trying to put a frame on it, structure their own project.  And then phase three is the main work part where they do either theoretically or work on data or they... In addition every project must have an experimental part, so they need to measure something, put their hands on something, either on a model and measure in a cold lab how the temperature decreases with a certain amount of heating or measure some radiation input as in a snowy environment, in a non-snowy environment, look at the differences and do things like that.

No, for the last year edition some the budget for you know what they called high potential Semaine ENAC so there was an additional budget to get I don\uFFFDt know, buy equipment or improve the existing Semaine ENAC or to create new ones.  And so there were a couple of incentives to promote this and now I would say with the succession of Jean d\uFFFDAnie [?] who did the Jean d\uFFFDAnie [inaudible], who did the [inaudible] before now with Monique there is a new dynamic.  And I think people start to feel that it is... That the whole concept of Projeter d'Ensemble is supported and carried by ENAC, by direction of ENAC as well.  \nAnd what\uFFFDs still not completely clear is the valorisation and appreciation of those who are really involved and engaged that you know, sometimes it\uFFFDs... Some colleagues still consider it as not really as hard science and like a... If you want to really be nasty and a waste of time for like a bit of... A week of blah blah and we are really motivated to change this image and I think our Semaine ENAC is fairly substantial.

And the third time they do the project, they\uFFFDre working with material that\uFFFDs a little bit more familiar to them, in that they\uFFFDve already done it once.  So you know, in that sense, these three sessions structure the hands on element.  \nAnd I would say that the lectures, the two lectures that we did are, you know, come at the early part of the week to maybe put them in a mind-set that makes them a little critical of reflective of how they\uFFFDre working.  So that they can not only do things and work together, but also maybe be in mind-set to kind of think about how they\uFFFDre doing things, and think about how they\uFFFDre working together." .

And so I thought about it and it was, I thought it was a really good idea and also, since we are at SLF in the role [?] as part of the WSL we are also used to work close to application oriented research.  I was also motivated by that so that, it gives a good bridge and we want to have the students work on demand environment and so there were several good aspects for motivation." .

We have... you know, our students of architecture; [French] civil engineering; and environment.  They are relatively young students, so they don't necessarily already have a strong identity, they\uFFFDre just acquiring it.  The architects are a little bit clearer about it, perhaps.  But for the others, I think, they're in the process of building it.  So, you can't really say \uFFFD this is my personal opinion \uFFFD that they are... completely self-identifying, as being a civil engineer, and then mixing their competencies with someone who is clearly an environmental engineer.  I think it just doesn\uFFFDt work like that.  There may be a way of modelling it, which can be useful, on a very aggregate level, but on the ground, it\uFFFDs not like that at all." .

And we had, for the first, as one Week is very short, so we had the Week before and Monday, Tuesday, we used these to get together with all of the fixed groups and to start working before the Week and with the know-how already of what they had to do and so they can get some information from the internet and some other places.  So we were really, how can I say this, we were running already, otherwise it takes one or two days to be efficient.  The first day was kind of the special, making specialists or project specialists and the second day was about making the project, being in the classroom, and the third day this was working on the site.  But then we had one Tuesday, after the Week, we had two hours to organise what would they create as an presentation, as a document, and the second Tuesday, after the Week, it was the presentation itself." .

And so the way I proceed was to give a base of theoretical content at the beginning usually, so this is done normally one week before the real intense week in Davos. And in parallel there is also, I think this is very important, to give, to show case studies. So I think it\uFFFDs important for the students to have reference of something that has been done in a sense, and that they can draw inspiration from.\n	And then there is a first phase that is based on observation and discussion, but I would say limited discussion during the first brainstorming of the students among, in their groups. So I\uFFFDm for giving some freedom in the students to really come up with their idea without influencing them too much, but still try to guide them and, yes, arise some discussion on their concept definition.\n	Then there is a third phase of detailed supervision. So then you really can give some technical suggestions and guidance. \n	And then there is also the experimental part, so they try to complement what they\uFFFDre theoretically developing with some practical application. And as teachers we also try to accept their experiments and to guide them and to suggest some methodologies to optimise them.\n	And then the final support in the finalisation of the project. \n	So these are, I think, the five points of the teaching structure along the week." .

That\uFFFDs the key competence on the environmental sciences question, so we can measure heat fluxes with them, we can measure radiation transfer and explain them how diffuse or and direct radiation works and how that is reflected by the snow surface.  \n	Things like that are key competences and then we combine that with the competence on how to actually construct and design buildings, also from an energy point of view.  And that is more the architectural side of competence that we bring in there.  Where we have a focus however again on the energy physics so we\uFFFDre doing a lot of...

<http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/interview1> <http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/content> "But that was also part of the difficulty because you realise after two years for instance that in social sciences for instance we do have a much longer or much smooth rhythm of doing research.\nSP1	Okay.\nSP2	First of all because we also need to go inside of city to collect... To have data but also social sciences take more time to implement, to research, to... Because we need to check a lot of different factors which is the same also in engineering for sure.  But my experience or our experience on doing research in a multidisciplinary is that sometimes, not always in that was everyone of course.  But every topic or discipline but sometimes in engineer it\uFFFDs much more... The speed is much more higher.\nSP1	Yes, yes.\nSP2	And here you do have some times of discrepancy between the rhythm, much more long, much more... I will not say deep because it\uFFFDs not a question of deepness but it just... It\uFFFDs another way of doing research.\nSP1	Yes.\nSP2	And that is something that we experience a couple of time when we did some research for instance with engineer.\nSP3	Yes.\nSP2	For instance in social science you cannot have result after one month.\nSP1	Yes, sure.\nSP2	You need to do field work, you need to reflect on text, you need to organise a problematic, you need to understand so many vary other factors.\nSP1	Yes.\nSP2	But then again you need also to have another framework, a more general universal framework to see what are the differences and that takes times.\nSP1	Yes, sure.\nSP2	It\uFFFDs not... And sometimes my... Our feeling was that was engineer as it is more sometimes based on modelling, on other types of experience you got result more quicker.  \nSP1	Yes, okay.\nSP2	And that can be sometimes more.." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/interview432> <http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/content> "So, as I said, working with the built environment and the way of the transformation of the city is interdisciplinary by definition, and so students really learn how to bring and reconsider their specific expertise in a multi-criteria design project. So this is, I think, the key interdisciplinary aspect of that, so it\uFFFDs\uFFFD\n	But I would also say that it\uFFFDs both from the students side, but also from the teaching side, or also for us as the teachers it\uFFFDs very interesting to get involved and to still learn something new about other aspects. So it\uFFFDs definitely a twofold learning along this process." .

And then in terms of teaching we are a big team I think, like this year we were six, seven for 25 students that\uFFFDs quite an impressive ratio.  And we accompany them in their process of doing a project and we interact a lot with them in group discussions like all the experts from the teaching side talking to the individual groups.  We have usually groups of five students and so after the lectures it becomes really, really interactive and another I think interesting tool that we are using is what we call the desk critique.  That all teachers come typically twice during the week and visit the small groups and we discuss with them their project, this is like a collective, interactive discussion." .

Not really, well there may be competition in a sense that you say I have already four lectures and I don\uFFFDt have time to do a Semaine ENAC.  Or the other way around, you really do a Semaine ENAC fully involved and then you say okay, then I cannot do my fourth lecture anymore or an additional one.

It\uFFFDs the approach that I\uFFFD  And, in fact, it was not me in my lab that has been approached, it was another, a colleague who did the thing about climate change, snow coverage and economic impact.  Some economies that do general equilibrium models, and they found out that, well, climate change and low Earth, no coverage is good for Switzerland, in a general equilibrium model.  Because other countries will be more impacted than Switzerland, so the demand will go to Switzerland and the price will increase and the value added will increase. So that was that kind of research and it is why he has been contacted by that time.  And he had no time, and he asked me if I wanted to do something, and I said oh yes. " .

And then, you know, the question of kind of what they make, what they could build became an important one, or an interesting one.  And I had seen that there was a competition that I think ENAC sponsored to build a bridge out of toothpicks.  \nOr something like this that they do every year, where architects and sometimes engineers end up doing some proposed, you know, a model that they then have to use to carry a certain weight.  So that made me think something in that context.  \nBut I wanted it to be at a larger scale.  And I wanted it to be at the scale of an actual object that would have an actual function, also.  And then, the idea of the cantilever was just something that I had been thinking about.  Obviously, just as an interesting kind of structural idea, which has also certain kinds of implications, in terms of kind of its representational or representative qualities.  \nSo it brought together kind of structural ideas with architectural ideas with also, in terms of building that out of wood.

But, I think a lot of them worked very hard and they felt that the time... the way time is organised in a single week is really a big challenge.  And I remember that Dominque was coming to see us two months before, even three months before, already, you know: what are we going to do on the Monday afternoon.

This year we had addition number five.  So we can also, we have a little tradition already so that we can definitely talk about an evolution.  The evolution was linked a little bit to the teaching staff where we had over the years a bit of fluctuation.  Some people joining, some people leaving and of course this always brings a little bit different... New elements in a way but we did not change the overall topic that remained.  But I think from year to year we got a bit more professional and more experience.  The topics remained, we also saw after the first one or two editions what was feasible, what we can ask for, what they can do in a week.  And I think at the end as I said we... The topic did not change so much, that means we did in my opinion a pretty good choice at the beginning.  Which was fairly well thought because the very first year we really spent a lot of times, we had long documents and we were circulating these documents between teaching staff part of... Or teachers of this particular Semaine ENAC.  And tailored it such that we really integrated elements from all three sections.  So in this sense I think there was not a major turn but every year we optimised a bit. " .

He was also helping a lot with trying to see, you know, that they can actually build their little models and all the idea about wind tunnel testing and so that these were locally developed at SLF.  \n	And so it was also an interactive process, we then thought it would be good to involve the local energy company so we, since I already knew the CEO there so I asked him if he would come and give a lecture.  And so I think we had a few meetings initially with the group at the time and this is where the concept evolved" .

Learn from this and really be able to apply a second time and the lesson learned from the first, and really improve yourself in that. So I think this is a very interesting reasoning we made recently. So I think there will be a sort of, a change of teaching inside our lab for the contribution we give to Semaine ENAC which is fair enough, I think." .

So they have to do the economic assessment, if it makes economic sense, they have to make the design, the architectural or design aspect of it and they have to, it has to be renewable so they have to look at it from an environmental side and an energy side, so they have to do calculations, is the energy input sufficient for what they want to achieve, is the house self-sufficient with respect to energy or not, is the cable car running on solar only, is that possible, how much storage do you need.

Typically they are three, three hours and in these three hours we give an introduction like a global introduction of what the Semaine ENAC will be about.  This is after they have selected the Semaine ENAC because there is normally in December all the ENAC weeks are presented to all the students and then they make their choice and they get signed up.  And then they come in our Semaine ENAC and we do a kind of introduction to explain them what we are going to do, what is expected from them also.  And then we typically start to give them a common background that means a couple of lectures, well these are lectures but we try to keep them as interactive as possible.  That they can always ask their questions that it could even turn into a discussion while we still manage to give them all the information they need.  But it\uFFFDs not a classical ex cathedra [?] to some extent yes because you know they are diverse and so we have to create a common base and then we go from there.  \nSo that is the preparation and there is a lot of logistics in our case that has to be communicated.  Like because we are not on campus, like where to go, what to bring and so on.  This is... Should not be underestimated, I am typically taking care of all that, I have to say I\uFFFDm taking care of a big part in terms of the preparation.  Because simply because Mihi has a lower presence here but so I do the presentation in December, I do usually most of the lectures and if somebody other... Somebody else is lecturing I am present.  I do most of the logistics in terms of reservations, get the tickets and inform them.  Set up the Moodle site which is also another key word." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/interview99> <http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/content> "the first version was already quite successful.  \n	And it seemed the key to success there was that we were available during the Week to guide the students in their individual development and steps, so we were sort of very closely following what they were actually doing.  And I think that\uFFFDs a key for success in that particular format because if we give them the freedom then we want to make sure that they don\uFFFDt run off doing something completely stupid, and then it\uFFFDs important that you follow them closely during the Week. " .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/interview12> <http://www.semanticweb.org/herus/Focus/content> "So I think spent really a lot of time for a good concept that attracts the students from all sections.  I think it\uFFFDs also important that it\uFFFDs broad enough that you don\uFFFDt have only one part, like only civil engineers coming because you are a I don\uFFFDt know, checking stability of bridges or whatever.  This is important, I think that\uFFFDs the base for success of a Semaine ENAC that the topic is attractive and I think it\uFFFDs not a huge problem if it is partly redundant with what already exists.
